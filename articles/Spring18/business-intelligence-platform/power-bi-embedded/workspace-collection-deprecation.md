#  Workspace collection deprecation




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

In June 2017, we announced the ability to embed Power BI using new APIs and the
convergence of the APIs with the Power BI Service. This was announced as part of
the Power BI Premium offers followed by Power BI Embedded offering in Azure. At
the same time, we announced the deprecation of the Workspace Collection offering
that will be effective from June 2018.

There’s a migration path from the Workspace Collection solution to the new Power
BI Embedded solution. Starting in June 2018, there won’t be a way to create a
new Workspace Collection and applications that will use this solution need to
migrate to the enhanced Power BI Embedded offering.
