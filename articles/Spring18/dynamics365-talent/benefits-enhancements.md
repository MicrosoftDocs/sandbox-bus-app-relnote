-   **Benefits open enrollment (Public Preview)**. Benefits open enrollment
    provides employees with an easy-to-follow, self-service experience for
    selecting their benefits. Human resource administrators can configure their
    organizationâ€™s benefits open enrollment process. They can also design the
    employee enrollment experience using a guided solution. Employee benefit
    enrollment elections can then be exported and sent to benefit providers.
