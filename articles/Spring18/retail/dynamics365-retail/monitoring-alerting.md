#  Monitoring and alerting




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Building on existing capabilities related to monitoring of tenant and
system-wide availability and reliability, this release extends these
capabilities to the next level of granularity by monitoring the health of
specific user operations. This ensures that, regardless of the relative volume
of operations performed in a customer's tenant, business-impacting issues are
immediately detected, and the reliability of the service remains high.

In addition to availability and reliability monitoring at the scenario level,
performance monitoring to proactively detect performance degradations for
high-value business operations has been implemented. To get comprehensive
coverage, the reliability alerting capability has been extended to the client
components, such as Modern POS. By seamlessly detecting issues logged at the
client components, itâ€™s now possible to detect reliability issues that are
specific to the client applications and that might not otherwise have been
detectable in the cloud service alone.
