They will have access to:

-   Electronic reporting and tax visual designers that let them create
    configurations for electronic document formats and tax calculation rules in
    accordance with country/region regulatory requirements.

-   Metadata capabilities that provide the ability to import a description of
    the target application’s artifacts, such as data tables, enumeration, and
    classes. These are used at design time to define data sources of a data
