#  LinkedIn Sales Navigator (SNAP) controls on forms




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

With LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration, business analysts and system admins
can add customizable form controls that deliver insights to help salespeople
build connections as they work deals. The controls provide a full view into
Sales Navigator member or company profiles, or focused views into lead
icebreakers, mutual connections, and related leads, as well as account
connections, recommended leads, and news.
