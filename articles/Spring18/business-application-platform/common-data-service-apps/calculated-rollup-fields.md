#  Calculated and rollup fields




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Calculated and rollup fields on Common Data Service for Apps entities make it
possible to easily compute values for any field and summarize multiple records
in a single rollup calculation.

Create calculated and rollup fields when you need to:

-   Create number-based calculations by using Excel-like formulas.

-   Concatenate and update text.

-   Create calculations by using values from related entities.

-   Create rollups of number fields.

-   Apply conditional calculations based on values in other fields.

-   Create rollups of date fields (for example, MAX(Datefield)).
