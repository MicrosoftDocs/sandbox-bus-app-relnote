#  Extensibility requests




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

If you discover a customization that you can't implement as an extension, you
can log a request to Microsoft to add appropriate extension support to the
product for your scenario. Currently, you can use the process described in the
[Extensibility requests
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/extensibility/extensibility-requests).
Also, in the Spring '18 timeframe, we are adding the Extensibility requests
feature to Lifecycle Services, and currently have it available for private
preview. This change lets you manage the work items that you've filed with
Microsoft in a single location.

To create an extensibility request, sign in to LCS, in the project for which you
need the additional extension support, and then from the Support Work items
workspace, create the request.
