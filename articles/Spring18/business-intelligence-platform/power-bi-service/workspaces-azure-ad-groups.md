#  Workspaces with Azure AD groups




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI workspaces have their own roles and permissions that are separate from
Office 365 groups, and which enable control over management of workspaces.
Capabilities include assigning workspace roles to individual users, Azure AD
security groups, and Office 365 modern groups. Additionally, governance of Power
BI workspaces is separated from governance of Office 365 modern groups.
