#  Business process flows 




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Use a business process flow to define a set of steps for people to follow to
take them to a desired outcome. These steps provide a visual indicator that
tells people where they are in the business process. Business process flows
reduce the need for training, because new users donâ€™t have to focus on which
entity they should be using. They can let the process guide them.

For example, you can configure business process flows to support common sales
methodologies that can help your sales groups achieve better results. Or, for
service groups, business process flows can help new staff get up to speed more
quickly and avoid mistakes that could result in unsatisfied customers. The user
experience can be tailored so that people with different security roles can have
an experience that best fits the work they do in PowerApps.

process flow to standardize
