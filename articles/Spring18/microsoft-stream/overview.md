# Microsoft Stream

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Stream is a service that enables your employees to create, discover,
and share videos securely across your organization, right inside the
collaboration apps they use most, such as Microsoft Teams, SharePoint,
Office 365, and Dynamics 365. Intelligence capabilities provide more ways to
find and interact with videos, and help people access relevant content quickly
and easily.

Microsoft Stream provides accessible, enterprise-grade security for
organizations of any size, and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to convert
speech to text, and face identification for smarter search.

Microsoft Stream empowers organizations to:

-   **Build an easy-to-use video experience that is familiar, appealing, and
    secure.** Microsoft Stream minimizes the learning curve for employees to do
    more with video at work.

-   **Integrate tightly into the business applications people use daily**.
    Microsoft Stream takes video to the productivity apps where people spend
    their time, and delivers a seamless, embedded experience. Additionally,
    embedded video in business applications brings video directly to apps where
    people work with customers.

-   **Create their own content.** Content creation tools allow employees create
    and publish content to Microsoft Stream. For example, videos created via
    meeting recordings in Microsoft Teams can be published and shared with
    others. AI techniques extract insights about the content and enable business
    users to make informed decisions.
