#  Incremental data refresh




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Organizations can use incremental data refresh to scale datasets to even larger
sizes. With incremental data refresh, users can load only new or changed data.
When creating a dataset in the Power BI Desktop, a user configures a refresh
table for each table in the model that is to load incrementally, and then
publishes it to a Power BI Premium workspace. Thereafter, each scheduled refresh
loads only new or changed data.
