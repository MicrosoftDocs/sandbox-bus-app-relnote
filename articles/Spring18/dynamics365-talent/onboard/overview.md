#  Dynamics 365 for Talent – Onboard




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The focus for Spring '18 updates has been to streamline onboarding at the
department level through more robust templates, reporting, and automation. Based
on customer feedback, Onboard has been enhanced with collaborative capabilities
to allow more individuals to create and implement onboarding experiences.
Onboard now also includes template authoring workflows to enable template
updates to be rolled out to all instances instantiated from the template.
