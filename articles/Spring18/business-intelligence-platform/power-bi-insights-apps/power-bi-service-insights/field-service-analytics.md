#  Field Service Analytics


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Field Service Analytics reports focuses on the dispatcher or scheduler
persona. The reports cover KPIs that help monitor the effectiveness of field
service operations. Report pages focus on open and closed work orders, as well
as bookings. The app helps answer questions like:

-   What is the average duration of an incident?

-   How many work orders have been completed by each field service engineer?
