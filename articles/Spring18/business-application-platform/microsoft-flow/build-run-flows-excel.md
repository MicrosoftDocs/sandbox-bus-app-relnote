#  Build and run flows from Excel




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

With the new Flow button, create and trigger automations from Flow on your table
data in Excel to automate data processing or the copying/importing of data. You
can create and run on-demand flows for selected rows in any Excel table on
spreadsheets hosted in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business.

To get started, in Excel, select the Flow button on the Data tab. From the Flow
launch panel, build your flow by using the For a selected row trigger, or start
from one of the templates:

-   For a selected row -\> send email

-   For a selected row -\> create an entity in Dynamics

-   For a selected row -\> send for approval

-   For a selected row -\> post a message to Teams

-   For a selected row -\> create a row in another spreadsheet

-   For a selected row -\> Post a message to Twitter

After the flow is created, select a row, and then select the Play button to see
your flow in action.
