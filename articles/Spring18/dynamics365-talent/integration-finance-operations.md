#  Integration with Finance and Operations 7.2 and 7.3 (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

In March, we enabled a connected story for Dynamics customers who are operating
in our cloud service and using Finance and Operations. Finance and Operations
customers will use Talent as the single source of truth for all their HR data.
The new integration features provide an initial data upload into Talent and then
provide ongoing integration to maintain Finance and Operations workflows and HR
transactions.
