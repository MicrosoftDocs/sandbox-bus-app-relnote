#  Pass in the date and time for search parameters by using the URL


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

When creating dynamic searches using URLs, previously you could pass in the
search date range, but not the specific time of the search on each day. For
example, you could express that you need a resource between April 1 and April 3,
but you couldnâ€™t express that a resource is needed between April 1 at 8 AM and
April 3 at 5 PM. Now you can specify a date and a time for the search beginning
and end. [See this blog for related details about building searches dynamically
