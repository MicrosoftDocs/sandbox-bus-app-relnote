#  End-of-day processing




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

End-of-day processing is a crucial element of retail operational workflow. This
involves aggregation of raw transactions into meaningful business data to ensure
that business and accounting rules are conformed to, before posting transactions
as official business records. Improving the reliability and performance of this
batch process and increasing the visibility of the processing for the
administrator improves the user experience. Users can easily monitor the
progress of the processing and see exactly what caused a validation failure. As
a result, they can quickly resolve the issue and reliably retry the process
without contacting Microsoft Support.

New capabilities include improved statement posting performance by removing
table deadlocks and optimizing batch processing. The introduction of a state
model in the posting process aids in rollback and recovery, which eliminates
data corruption and the need for manual intervention. Enhanced in-app
diagnostics with detailed status, errors, and logs (including details of
transactions included in the scope of the statement, transactions resulting in
errors, and possible steps to correct issues) allow for easy troubleshooting.
