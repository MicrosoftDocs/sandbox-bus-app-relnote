#  Query acceleration for large datasets (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can create
[DirectQuery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-directquery-about)
models over any size data in sources, such as Spark and Azure SQL Data
Warehouse, and then accelerate common queries by building in-memory aggregations
over some of the data. Common queries use the aggregated cache to return results
in a fraction of a second instead of directly querying the source. Users can
create datasets of massive size and still provide interactive querying.
