#  Server-side logic for validation




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Business rules on Common Data Service for Apps entities make it possible to
visually define server-side business logic for canvas and model‑driven apps.

Use business rules to:

-   Set default values for form fields based on logical parameters.

-   Create simple and multi-step validation logic for any entity field, or for a
    combination of fields.

-   Trigger workflows and other processes directly from rule logic.
