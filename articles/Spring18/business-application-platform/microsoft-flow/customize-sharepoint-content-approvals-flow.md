#  Customize SharePoint content approvals with Flow




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

For any modern SharePoint page libraries, site administrators and owners can
turn on content approvals for new edits. With content approvals turned on,
whenever a change is made to a page, it's put into Pending mode and submitted
for approval. This in turn results in a new approval item for designated
approvers. An approver can review changes and either approve them directly in
SharePoint by using an embedded Flow experience or respond on the approvals
center, on their phone, or directly from email. When an approver responds, the
content author is notified, the change is published, and the page is updated.Â
