#  Display more on the schedule board by adjusting the scale


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can adjust the scale of the schedule board to decrease the width of the
columns to view a wider date range. Whether you are viewing the hourly, daily,
weekly, or monthly board, youâ€™ll see a scale control at the bottom of the
screen.
