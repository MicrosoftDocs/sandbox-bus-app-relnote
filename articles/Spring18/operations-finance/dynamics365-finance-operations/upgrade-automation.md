#  Upgrade automation




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Upgrade automation makes major version upgrades a self-service operation for
customers, using LCS for non-production environments. Upgrade automation
includes environment, data, and code upgrades. Customers can also diagnose and
fix issues as needed. This improves automation reliability and reduces downtime
for servicing.
