#  Assignee placeholders (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Managers can insert assignee placeholders in their template, to be filled out
later. For example, a group of tasks can be assigned to “business administrator”
in a template. Then, when the someone uses that template, they specify who
“business administrator” is. This allows for more flexibility and template
reuse.
