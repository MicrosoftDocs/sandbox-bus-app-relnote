#  Customizable out-of-the-box apps


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Through AppSource, users can discover out-of-the-box [Power BI
apps](../power-bi-apps-common-data-service-analytics/index.md) from Microsoft and third parties that provide
domain-optimized analytics based on Common Data Service for Analytics, which are
customizable using Power BI. These solutions leverage and extend the common
schema to build solutions with pre-built dashboards, reports, and datasets with
domain-specific insights that are optimized for Q&A and Cortana. These
experiences are available in Cortana, Power BI, and DynamicsÂ 365.
