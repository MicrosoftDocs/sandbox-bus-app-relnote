These release notes provide descriptions of new and enhanced capabilities in
Dynamics 365 business applications and application platforms. These capabilities
are available starting in April 2018.

To make it easy to find a list of changes for each business application or
platform, there’s a quick summary table in each section with links to any
relevant information.
