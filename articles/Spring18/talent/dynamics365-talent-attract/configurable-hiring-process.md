#  Configurable hiring process




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Configurable hiring process features let customers fit Attract to their unique
needs by using an out-of-box hiring process, or by configuring tailored hiring
processes and saving them for future use. This allows customers to create a
distinct hiring process for an individual job or apply a hiring process template
to a job. This feature can be helpful in a complex enterprise hiring
environment. (Templates will be available in late April 2018.)

Customers can add or remove stages to their hiring process. Within stages,
activities can be added to tailor the process to an organizationâ€™s needs. For
example, an organization can set up different processes for different types of
jobs. For seasonal workers, there might be just one interview stage, but for
full-time employees, the process might be more complex and consist of multiple
screening and interview stages.
