#  Predictive lead scoring (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Predictive lead scoring uses a predictive machine learning model to calculate a
score for all open leads. The score helps salespeople to prioritize leads,
achieve higher lead qualification rates, and reduce the time it takes to qualify
a lead. The reasons behind the score adds transparency to the model and helps
salespeople validate the model.

The administration experience allows a business analyst to train the model and
apply it to open leads for scoring based on prediction accuracy. In addition,
when there is more data for leads or other related entities such as accounts, a
business analyst can retrain the model and apply it to achieve more accurate
results. Plus, the business analyst can change the score ranges for lead grades
to determine lead prioritization for their business based on qualification
rates.
