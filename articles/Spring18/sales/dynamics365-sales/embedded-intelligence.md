#  Embedded intelligence




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

**Embedded intelligence** (previously known as Relationship Insights) collects,
manages, and analyzes the diverse data and communications created throughout the
sales process. The app then automatically suggests relevant actions and captures
relevant activities to let salespeople spend more time selling.

This includes **Relationship assistant**, **Auto capture**, and **Email
engagement**.

-   **Relationship assistant** offers timely and actionable insights by
    continuously analyzing customer interaction data stored in Dynamics 365,
    Microsoft Exchange, and other sources, and then generating a collection of
    action cards with suggestions for relevant next steps.

-   **Auto capture** scans a sales user’s Outlook inbox for messages and
    appointments relevant to deals they’re working in Dynamics 365, and then
    offers them as candidates for tracking. [Watch

-   **Email engagement** monitors actions taken by recipients such as opened,
    clicked on a link, opened an attachment, or replied. Sales users can
    schedule when an email is sent and receive follow-up reminders.
