#  Return data to PowerApps from a flow




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Use Microsoft Flow to create logic that performs one or more tasks when an event
occurs in a PowerApp. For example, configure a button that creates an item in a
SharePoint list, sends an email or meeting request, or creates an online file.
You can also use a flow toÂ return data to PowerApps. For example, configure a
flow that retrieves data from a web endpoint, a SQL Server, or an Excel file in
SharePoint, and then processes that data by using built-in actions. You can
configure any control in the app to start the flow, which continues to run even
if you close PowerApps.
