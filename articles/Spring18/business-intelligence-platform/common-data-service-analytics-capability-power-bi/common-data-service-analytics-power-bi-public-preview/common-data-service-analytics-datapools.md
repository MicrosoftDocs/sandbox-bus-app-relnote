#  Common Data Service for Analytics datapools


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

In addition to dashboards, reports, workbooks and datasets, Common Data Service
for Analytics introduces a new concept called datapools, which are sets of
Common Data Service for Analytics entities. These datapools can be created,
installed, browsed, and configured for data refresh from within the Power BI
Service. A Get Data type of experience enables users to view and modify the
entities, attributes, and relationships from within Power BI and leverage
pre-built connectors and the on-premises data gateway to easily bring disparate
data into Common Data Service for Analytics, and map it to the extensible
schema. The preview includes out-of-the-box connectivity to Software as a
Service (SaaS)business applications like DynamicsÂ 365 and Salesforce.
