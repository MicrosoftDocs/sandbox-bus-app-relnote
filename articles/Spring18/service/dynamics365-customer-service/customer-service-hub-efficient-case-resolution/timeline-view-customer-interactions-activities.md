#  Timeline view of customer interactions and activities 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Capture customer interactions and communications by adding them as activities in
the timeline section of the dashboard. The timeline section presents a unified
view of everything that has happened with a case, such as email received,
follow-up tasks, and automatically generated system posts, plus any notes taken
during customer interactions.
