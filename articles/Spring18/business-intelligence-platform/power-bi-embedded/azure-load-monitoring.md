#  Azure load monitoring




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Expanding the available metrics to monitor the consumption of a resource in
Power BI Embedded and trigger actions by thresholds. The following four metrics
are exposed:

-   Memory consumption

-   Memory thrashing

-   CPU spikes over 80 percent

-   DirectQuery usage

In addition, developers can use Azure to define thresholds to trigger specific
actions using alerts, such as automatic scale-up of the resource whenever a
specific monitor crosses the defined threshold.
