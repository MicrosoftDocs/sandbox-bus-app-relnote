#  Improved delivery of platform and financial reporting updates




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Starting April 1, 2018, platform and financial reporting updates will be
continual updates managed by Microsoft rather than optional updates. This change
is intended to improve service reliability and availability, and also to ensure
that customers have the latest improvements and fixes. Platform and financial
reporting updates are backward-compatible. Platform updates don't require any
change in your customizations.

-   If you purchase subscriptions to Finance and Operation after April 1, 2018,
    you will automatically begin receiving continual updates.

-   For platform updates, if you're an existing customer and have Platform
    update 11 or earlier installed, you will be asked to move to Platform update
    12 by April 1, 2018. By July 1, 2018, all customers will receive continual
    platform updates managed by Microsoft.

Starting with the Spring â€˜18 release, platform updates for both on-premises and
online deployments will be available together.

Continual updates will be applied first to the sandbox environment and then on
production.

These enhancements to the way software updates are provided will improve
deployment time and the reliability of servicing, and will also lead to
significantly reduced downtimes. These changes also provide the ability to
elastically scale computing resources without downtime. We believe that these
changes will result in gains for customers in the long term, allowing them to
take advantage of cloud innovation and capabilities.
