#  Price mark-ups and mark-downs 


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Prices can be set up as a percent-based markup on a base price, for example, to
reflect overtime hours or hazardous work conditions. This mark-up or mark-down
ties to configured pricing dimensions, such as role or resourcing unit, as
defined by the administrator. Priority-based mark-up or mark-down resolution is
also supported.
