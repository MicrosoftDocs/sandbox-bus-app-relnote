#  Approval reassignment




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

If you can’t or don’t want to complete an approval yourself, you can now send
the approvals you receive to another person. First, click the approval in the
Approval center, and then select Advanced in the approval pane. You can then
provide the email address of the user that you want to handle the approval on
your behalf. After you reassign the approval, that user will see the approval
request in their Approval center.

You can also reassign from the ellipsis (...) menu on each approval in your
received requests.
