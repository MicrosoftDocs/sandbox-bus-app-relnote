#  Power BI Insights apps




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Deliver out-of-box insights tailored to specific business scenarios across
marketing, sales, service, finance, operations, and talent management. Insights
are generated by applying advanced intelligence to a subset of unique Microsoft
data, such as business, productivity and collaboration, and professional network
data. Also, customers can easily incorporate additional data from a range of
third-party sources to enhance relevance and accuracy. Power BI Insights apps
can be further tailored by applying the full power of Azure Data Services.
