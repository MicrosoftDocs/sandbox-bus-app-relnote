#  See details of a flow 




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

When you run a flow that has been shared with you, you can see details of
exactly what that flow is going to do with your connections. Whenever you run a
flow, select **See details** to view a list of every action that the flow uses
(both name and description). Because the flow can use your accounts or
connections, you should only ever run a flow if you trust the owner of the flow
and are comfortable having them take the actions listed under **See details**.Â
