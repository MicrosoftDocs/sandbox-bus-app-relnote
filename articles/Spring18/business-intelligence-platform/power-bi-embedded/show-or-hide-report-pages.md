#  Show or hide report pages 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

When a report is being embedded in an application, all the pages of the reports
are available. There are scenarios in which the developer wants to control pages
of the reports that will be available to the applicationâ€™s user. This capability
is available when creating reporting in the Power BI Desktop and using them in
the Power BI Service. The **report.getPages** API is updated to enable control
of the report pages from the application at runtime.
