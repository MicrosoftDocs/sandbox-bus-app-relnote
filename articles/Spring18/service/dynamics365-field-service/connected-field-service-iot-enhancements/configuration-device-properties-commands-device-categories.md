#  Configuration of device properties and commands through device categories




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

When IoT devices are registered, connected, and configured in Azure IoT hub,
Connected Field Service is able to retrieve properties and configurations from
device twins.

With the Spring â€˜18 release, field service managers and technicians can define
device properties individually or in bulk. For example, field service managers
can add measurements, such as temperature or vibration, which are common to
devices in a category, and then update properties, configure thresholds, or send
commands.

Field service managers or technicians can also use pre-defined commands to
control a piece of equipment, such as when to restart or shut down.
