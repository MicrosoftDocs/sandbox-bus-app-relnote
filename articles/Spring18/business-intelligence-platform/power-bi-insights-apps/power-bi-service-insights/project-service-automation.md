#  Project Service Automation


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Project Service Automation reports focus on information that’s critical to a
Practice Manager, Resource Manager, and Account Manager. The app provides
tailored reporting and insights for each role:

-   **Practice Manager.** Responsible for revenue goals, project completion, and
    customer satisfaction for service engagements delivered. The app provides
    key insights around gross margins, revenue, costs, and utilization to help
    answer questions like:

-   Who are the most profitable customers?

-   Where are the largest costs on a project incurred?

-   **Resource Manager.** Responsible for assigning the right resources to the
    projects at the right time. The app provides key insights about resource and
    role utilization, as well as unfulfilled demand to help answer questions
    like:

-   What does the utilization rate look like for developers over the last six
    weeks?

-   Is there enough resource capacity to fulfill incoming requests?

-   **Account Manager.** Responsible for driving revenue from the customers. The
    app provides key insights about closed deals, billed versus unbilled sales,
    and ongoing engagements to help answer questions like:

-   On average, how long does it take to close a deal?

-   How are current contracts performing?
