#  Smart alerts




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Receive automatic alerts when there are important changes to data. A library of
pre-built algorithms automatically runs to determine the best insights for
users, and automatically delivers alerts to them. The alerts have additional
controls that allow customizing the alerts.
