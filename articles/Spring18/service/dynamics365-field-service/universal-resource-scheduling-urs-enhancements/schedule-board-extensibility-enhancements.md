##### Multi-select option set fields can be queried and displayed

When modifying a UFX query for an extensible scheduling scenario, you can now
query multi-select option set fields. Additionally, you can display selected
values in a multi-select option set on the resource cell template.

##### Ignore or consider proposed bookings when searching for availability (change default)

The February 2018 update introduced the ability to ignore or consider proposed
bookings when searching for resource availability. With the April update, you
can now change the default value from always defaulting to ignore proposed
bookings. [For more information, see this blog post from February 2018, in the
section Ignore or consider proposed
bookings](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2018/02/19/whats-new-in-universal-resource-scheduling-for-dynamics-365-february-2018-update/).
