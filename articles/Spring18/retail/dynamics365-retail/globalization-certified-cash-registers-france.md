#  Globalization: Certified cash registers for France




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

As of January 1, 2018, all retailers in France must use cash systems certified
per the NF525 requirements. The requirements cover inalterability, security,
retention, and archiving of information pertaining to cash sales. New
capabilities were implemented to fulfill the NF525 requirements. These
requirements were confirmed by a certificate issued by an accredited body. The
capabilities include:

-   Retail POS capabilities:

-   Digital signing of all retail sales transactions, and also end-of-day
    reports and audit events.

-   Additional required data fields that can be added to receipt layouts,
    including an extract of the digital signature of the signed retail
    transaction, software version, count of receipt lines, and so on.

-   Registration of audit events, such as printing a copy of a receipt,
    entering/exiting offline mode, and so on.

-   Additional required data in end-of-day reports (X/Z reports), including
    cumulative grand totals, decomposition of shift totals per tax code, and so
    on.

-   Options to restrict shift duration to one day.

-   Retail headquarters capabilities:

-   A period grand total journal that calculates retail sales and returns totals
    per store for a period and cumulatively, and also the decomposition of
    totals per tax code. A calculated and closed journal is digitally signed.

-   Archiving the export of retail sales data for a closed period, such as a
    closed period grand total journal. This includes transaction data for
    transactions completed in the period, shift data for shifts closed in the
    period, audit event data for events in the period, and the period grand
    total data. The resulting export file is digitally signed.
