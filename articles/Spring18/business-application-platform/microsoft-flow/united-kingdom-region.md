We are announcing availability of the United Kingdom region for Microsoft Flow.
This means that you can create Environments in the UK, and all the flow customer
data will be maintained solely within the UK. You can read more about our
commitments to storing data on the Microsoft Trust CenterÂ [page for Microsoft
Flow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/business-application-platform/data-location).
