#  Customizations through extensions only




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

In the Spring '18 release, we’ve continued our work to allow our application
code base be customized only through extensions. We are removing the ability to
over-layer customizations. The primary benefits of this change include:

-   Removing the ability to create intrusive customizations, to make customized
    environments more robust.

-   Simplified application lifecycle management for customizations: Customers
    will no longer have to merge code, or compile and deploy Microsoft code.
    This will lead to shorter build times and a shorter development lifecycle.

-   Making it possible for customers to be on the latest release of Finance and
    Operations. This is just one of the key steps in this process.

To take advantage of the new extensibility features, partners and customers need
to convert their existing overlayered customizations to extensions. To support
this move, we have updated our extensibility documentation, which has details
about the process of migrating existing code to extensions, and also specific
articles about platform capabilities and application frameworks and how to
extend them: [Extensibility
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/extensibility/extensibility-home-page).
We have future work planned to improve the Code upgrade service and development
tools to facilitate this migration.
