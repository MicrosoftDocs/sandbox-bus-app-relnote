#  Schedule board list view




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

With the Spring ’18 release, the schedule board list view helps users interact
with the schedule board using a list view to see data in a more meaningful way.
For example, use the list view to work with bookable resources on the schedule
board, or when searching for resource availability in hourly, daily, weekly, or
monthly schedule board views.
