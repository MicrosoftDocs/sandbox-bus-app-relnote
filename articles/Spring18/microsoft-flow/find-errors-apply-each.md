#  Find errors in Apply to each




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

We recently increased the limits for Apply to each, which means that you can
have loops that contain thousands of items. However, if a small number of the
actions in these loops fail, it's important that you be able to jump directly to
the failure. This week, we are adding new functionality: in the run view, there
are two new buttons to take you directly to the next and previous *failed*
items. You can now quickly go through only the failures in your actions to
identify what went wrong, even if there are thousands of items in the loop.
