#  Globalization – Enhanced configurability




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Configurability of globalization features lets partners and customers do
customizations without coding. We continue to extend not only the depth of
configurability, by adding new features for import and testing scenarios, but
also the breadth of configurability, by configuring features that were
previously hard-coded, such as the free text invoice layout. Telemetry for all
regulatory features lets us track usage of these features and proactively
respond to any issues partners and customers have with these features. New
capabilities include:

-   Support for import formats in batch mode and detailed log of errors during
    import. This feature lets customers automate end-to-end scenarios that
    involve both sending an electronic file and processing the response, such as
    for payments.

-   Configuration-specific data for validation. A business user can create test
    data in Microsoft Excel to fill the Electronic reporting (ER) data model
    that is defined in business terms, and use this data to validate the
    correctness of the output format, such as electronic invoices for tax
    authorities.

-   Configurable free text invoice (FTI) layout example. We provide a
    fully-configurable ER template that partners and customers can use as a
    basis for their customized invoices.

-   We track telemetry for all regulatory features, extending the coverage from
    configurable-only features.
