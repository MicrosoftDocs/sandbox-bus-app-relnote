#  Extensible project work breakdown structure




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The current hierarchal grid control used for the project work breakdown
structure is being deprecated and replaced with a standard grid that is enhanced
to support hierarchical data. This change will let you use extensions to
customize the project work breakdown structure. This feature is available in the
May 2018 application update.
