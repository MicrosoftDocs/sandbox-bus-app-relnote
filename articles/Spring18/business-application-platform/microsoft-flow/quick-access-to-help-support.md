#  Quick access to help and support




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

If you encounter issues when you’re building or running a flow, or encounter any
other issue while using Flow, open a support ticket from the Flow website (you
don’t have to go to a separate portal and sign in again to provide issue
details). If you open the support ticket from the page of a broken flow, the
flow ID details are automatically added to the ticket. The ticket contains
details about your user account plan and the broken flow, where applicable, and
will be sent to Microsoft support engineers so that they can quickly resolve the
issue.
