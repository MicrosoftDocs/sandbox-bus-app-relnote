#  Dynamics 365 for Sales professional user license




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Starting in Spring ’18, you can choose from two license types for sales:
professional (new) and enterprise (currently in market), depending on your
business requirements. To compare what’s included with each sales license option
and determine which plan would work best for your organization, [see the sales
pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/sales/).
