#  Lifecycle Services sandbox self-service automation and RDP lockdown




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Sandbox self-service automation supports data movement, debugging operations,
monitoring, and diagnostics without requiring access to the sandbox environments
through Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop capabilities for sandbox environments
will be deprecated. This means that customers wonâ€™t be required to use Remote
Desktop to access the VM, which improves reliability and security.
