#  Canvas apps support storing up to 20 MB of data locally on Android and iOS

Apps using the SaveData and LoadData functions for building offline-enabled apps
on PowerApps can now save up to 20 MB of data in a single SaveData/LoadData
call. This should enable common use cases like capturing images offline that are
later uploaded to the service.
