#  Bookmarks support




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

An application can apply bookmarks on the embedded report and control its UI
elements through APIs. With bookmark APIs, developers can control the experience
of the applicationâ€™s users by applying specific bookmarks on load or after
specific actions in the app's flow, show or hide the bookmarks pane, and apply
or disable the storytelling through bookmarks. You can also create a
personalized experience by capturing the report's state and creating a bookmark
to be managed and saved by the application. Developers can control who can use
the bookmark and when to apply it to the report. Use the following APIs:

-   **getBookmarks**

-   **bookmarksManager.apply**

-   **bookmarksManager.capture**

-   **bookmarksManager.applyState**
