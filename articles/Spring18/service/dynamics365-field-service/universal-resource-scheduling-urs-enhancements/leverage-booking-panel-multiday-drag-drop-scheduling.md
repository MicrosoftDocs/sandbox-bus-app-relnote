#  Leverage the booking panel for multiday drag and drop scheduling


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Our latest investment is moving interactions to the booking panel and shifting
away from pop ups for creating bookings. Now, when you drag a booking from the
bottom booking requirements panel to the multiday schedule boards, instead of a
pop up, the booking panel slides out.

By using the panel instead of a pop up, you can interact with the schedule board
by changing dates and resources, which updates the booking panel with your
values. When you make your selections and are ready to book, just click the Book
button on the panel.
