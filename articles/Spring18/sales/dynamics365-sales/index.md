#  Dynamics 365 for Sales




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The capabilities in the Spring ’18 release empower your sales team with more
intelligence and analytics, deeper integrations with LinkedIn and Office 365,
and consistent user experience for web, mobile, and clients using the Unified
Interface framework.

These capabilities include:

-   **Embedded intelligence lets sellers focus on selling.** Embedded
    intelligence collects, manages, and analyzes the diverse data and
    communications throughout the sales process, and then automatically suggests
    relevant actions and captures relevant activities to let salespeople spend
    more time selling.

-   Embedded intelligence features introduced with this release are:

-   **Relationship assistant**, **Auto capture**, and **Email engagement**
    (previously these were part of a group of features named Relationship
    Insights) provide sales intelligence and are embedded within the Sales app.

-   **The Sales app is built on the Unified Interface framework for consistent
    user experience.** The Sales app delivers a consistent, uniform, user
    interface, and follows responsive design principles for optimal viewing on
    any screen size or device. All core sales entities used in business
    processes, including products, goals, and sales literature, run on this
    responsive platform and conform to [common data model](../../business-application-platform/microsoft-flow/access-modern-approvals-the-common-data-service-apps.md)
    standards.

>   Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration, and the
>   Gamification solution all run on the Unified Interface framework.

-   **User interface controls use a Common Controls Framework (CCF) for
    consistency.** Controls follow consistent, familiar patterns on every
    surface of the application, making it easier for sales users to learn and be
    productive.

-   **Enhanced integration with LinkedIn Sales Navigator enables a seamless
    sales workflow.** On forms, LinkedIn Sales Navigator controls provide
    up-to-date context and insights about companies and LinkedIn members.

-   **GDPR and accessibility enhancements.** Investments address the European
    privacy law’s requirements, and enhance accessibility for users who need
    assistive technologies to interact with the application.



-   **Professional user license for streamlined Sales Force Automation (SFA).**
    With the addition of the Professional user license, along with the
    Enterprise user license currently in market, you can choose the capabilities
    that make sense for your specific business requirements.

These additional capabilities are available for Public Preview:

-   **Dynamics 365 for Sales insights add-on provides advanced intelligence
    capabilities to salespeople.** The add-on includes Relationship analytics
    that show relationship and sentiment health.

Relationship analytics analyzes the overall health of customer relationships by
letting salespeople know how they’re spending their time and who they’re
interacting with. Relationship analytics also recommends which customers and
opportunities to focus on.

Sentiment health analyzes customer interactions and signals to inform
salespeople how satisfied their customers are with their relationship.

-   **Self-serve installation of the Dynamics 365 for Sales insights add-on
    speeds onboarding.** System administrators can quickly get set up with a
    simplified installation process.
