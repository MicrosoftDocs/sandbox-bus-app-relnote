#  Support for additional data types




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Data stored in the Common Data Service for Apps in both standard and custom
entities can use an updated list of data types. Data types provide basic
validation of the data stored in a field and also different experiences within
apps to ensure that the correct type of data is collected.

Support for IME Mode for complex characters and symbols such as Japanese Kanji
characters is now supported on Single and Multiline text data types.

New data types include:

-   Multi Select Option Sets. Allows multiple values to be selected from a
    drop-down.

-   Two Options. Similar to a Boolean data type but with customizable
    selections.

-   Floating Point Number. Similar to decimal number but provides greater
    control over precision.

-   Customer. Creates a lookup to a list of Accounts and Contacts within the
    Common Data Service for Apps.

Existing data types include:

-   Single Line of Text.

-   New formats for Email, URL, Ticker Symbol, and Phone.

-   Multiple Lines of Text.

-   Option Sets: New support for one-time in addition to reusable.

-   Whole Number.

-   Decimal Number.

-   Currency.

-   Date and Time.

-   Image.

-   Lookup.
