# Extensibility (Public Preview)

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

With the M connector SDK, partners and developers can contribute to the rich
connector ecosystem. Additionally, M connector support is provided for the
on-premises data gateway (personal mode), starting in April. An improved
certification program lets partners build and submit their connectors for review
and release across Power BI, Microsoft Flow, PowerApps, and Logic Apps.
