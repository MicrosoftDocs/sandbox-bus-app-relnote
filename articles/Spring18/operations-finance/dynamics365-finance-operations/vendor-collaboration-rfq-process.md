#  Vendor collaboration – RFQ process




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Organizations issue requests for quotation (RFQ) when they want to receive
competitive offers from several vendors for the items or services that they must
purchase. The introduction of the vendor’s ability to enter a bid for an RFQ
resulted in the need for explicitly indicating who entered bid data: the vendor
or the procurement department. This requirement is addressed by the introduction
of a new reply status. In addition, there is a new form dedicated to entering
bids, so that entering the bid and processing the bid are now handled on
separate forms.
