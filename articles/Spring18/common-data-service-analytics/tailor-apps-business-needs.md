#  Tailor apps to business needs


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI applications are customizable from data ingestion to visualization.
Users can alter the data pipeline to reflect customizations in source
applications. For example, users can bring in custom entities from DynamicsÂ 365.
For visualization, reports are extensible; users can change color schemes,
create new calculations and KPIs, and add visualizations and report pages.
