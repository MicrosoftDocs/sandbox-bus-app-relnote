#  Business Intelligence Platform




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Organizations can use Power BI to translate a wealth of data into actionable
insights. New Power BI capabilities in the Spring ’18 release include:

-   **Analytics and exploration experiences.** Features include an improved SAP
    HANA connector that treats SAP HANA as a multi-dimensional source, and
    capabilities for analysts to improve productivity with unique ways to
    visualize data. For example, users can use canvas tooltips to express more
    detail in context. Excel users who use the matrix visual receive
    measure-driven conditional formatting, and the ability to expand or collapse
    sections of the visual.

-   **Natural language analytics for everyone.** Authors can use some of the
    improvements to Q&A natural language experiences to add domain-specific
    language and phrasing tailored for their domain. Users can ask questions in
    the context of their workflow, which includes Cortana and reports in
    Dynamics 365. Users can identify trends or changes in their data using Smart
    alerts and enhanced Quick Insights.

-   **Enterprise-grade trusted platform.** Governance improvements include
    additional administrative controls, access to user content, and reporting.
    With Power BI Premium, you get improved scalability support with larger node
    sizes, incremental refresh for faster data loads, and deployments that span
    multiple geographic regions worldwide.
