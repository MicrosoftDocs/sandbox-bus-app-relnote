#  Book by estimated arrival time instead of start of travel




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

When resource managers search for availability, especially when the customer is
on the phone at the same time, itâ€™s important that they be able to communicate
the available appointment times efficiently. Previously, when resource managers
searched for availability for an onsite requirement, the gray recommended slot
that was drawn on the schedule board represented the available appointment time,
inclusive of travel. However, in many cases, especially when talking to a
customer, the resource manager cares most about when the resource will arrive.

To address this need, the solution lets you book by estimated arrival. When you
book based on estimated arrival on the schedule board, the recommended slot that
is shown is based on when the resource will arrive onsite instead of when the
resource will begin travel.

Resource managers who are more focused on arranging bookings without interacting
with customers can continue to use the current option to book by the start of
travel.
