#  Visual level configuration




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Control the experience and functionalities on a visual that is exposed to users.
The default behavior is to expose all the Power BI capabilities:

-   Show in Focus mode

-   Export data

-   Show data

-   Spotlight

The application will have the control to enable all the capabilities or only
part of them, as well as to decide whether to show the upper bar on the visual.
You can also configure these settings on for each visual.
