**Version management**

Create and manage different version of the manufacturing bill of materials and
routings.

**Agile manufacturing**

Plan rush hours, make exceptions, and handle last-minute changes to your

**Basic supply planning**

Plan for material requirements based on demand, with support for master
production scheduling and materials requirements planning.

**Demand forecasting**

Plan and create production and purchase orders, taking into consideration the
demand forecast together with the level of available inventory and parameters of

**Capacity planning**

Add capacities to the manufacturing process. Set up routings, and use these
routings on production orders and in material requirements planning.

**Machine centers**

Manage capacity on several levels: on a more detailed level for machine centers
and on a consolidated level for work centers.

**Finite loading**

Take capacity constraints into account, so that no more work is assigned to a
work center than the capacities can be expected to execute during a given time
