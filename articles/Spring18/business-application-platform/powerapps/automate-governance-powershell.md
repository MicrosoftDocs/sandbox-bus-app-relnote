#  Automate governance with PowerShell




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The new [PowerShell admin cmdlets](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/)
provide PowerApps admins with visibility and control over their organization's
usage of PowerApps and Flow. Most importantly, these cmdlets let admins of
larger organizations automate their application lifecycle management and monitor
the following areas:

-   Environments and environment permissions

-   PowerApps and app permission

-   Flows and flow permissions

-   Export and import of resource packages across environments

-   PowerApps and Flow licenses report (of active users)
