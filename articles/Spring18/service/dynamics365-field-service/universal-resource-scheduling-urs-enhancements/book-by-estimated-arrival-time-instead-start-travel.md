#  Book by estimated arrival time instead of start of travel


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

When resource managers search for availability, especially with the customer on
the phone at the same time, it is important that they can communicate the
available appointment times efficiently. Previously, when searching for
availability for an onsite requirement, the gray recommended slot drawn on the
schedule board represented the available appointment time, inclusive of travel.
However, in many cases, especially when talking to a customer, the resource
manager cares most about when the resource will arrive.

To address this need, the solution allows you to book by estimated arrival.
Electing to book based on estimated arrival on the schedule board displays the
recommended slot based on when the resource will arrive onsite, as opposed to
when they will begin travel.

Resource managers who are more focused on arranging bookings without interacting
with customers can continue to use the current option to book by the start of
travel.
