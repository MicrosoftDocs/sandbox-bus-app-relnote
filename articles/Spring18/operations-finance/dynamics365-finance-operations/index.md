#  Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Spring ‘18 release of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations delivers
enhancements in system performance, servicing, reliability, and extensibility.
It also offers new ways of integrating with other Dynamics 365 products and adds
to our suite of business productivity tools. Highlights from this release
include:

-   A shift to Microsoft-managed platform and financial reporting updates, to
    improve service reliability and availability, and also to ensure that
    customers have the latest improvements and can take advantage of cloud
    scaling capabilities.

-   Changing our approach to customization by moving from over-layering to
    enabling no-code extensibility. Extensions let Microsoft service Finance and
    Operations without disrupting customers, minimizing the impact and costs of
    subsequent releases. We’ve also added the ability to embed PowerApps in
    Finance and Operations forms pages and the ability to add custom fields
    without writing code.

-   Data integration capability that synchronizes data using customizable
    projects. Standard templates can be used to create custom integration
    projects, where additional standard and custom fields and entities can be
    mapped to adjust the integration and meet specific business needs. New data
    integration functionality is provided between features in Finance and
    Operations and features in Dynamics 365 for Field Service, Dynamics 365 for
    Talent, and Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation.

-   Lifecycle Services (LCS) tools that make it easier for customers to get
    support when they need it, including:

-   Telemetry-driven knowledge-base (KB) recommendations that help us understand
    how well hotfixes have solved an issue and proactively push out hotfixes to
    customers. This will allow customers to spend less time looking for
    solutions to issues that a hotfix already exists for.

-   Returning a list of KB recommendations when customers enter a support case
    and continuously refining search results based on the user’s input. This
    feature provides more relevant search results and reduces the need for
    customers to submit support cases by helping them find the solution before
    submitting a case.

-   Ability to report a production outage, providing a quick and effective
    channel to escalate issues to Microsoft Support if the services in a
    production environment are degraded or become unavailable.

-   Intelligence applications that analyze customers’ business processes and
    data, and proactively provide insights and recommendations. These include
    Optimization advisor and Credit and collections.

-   Enhancements to vendor collaboration and warehouse management tools,
    allowing customers to streamline and expedite business operations.

-   Investments in globalization features, including support for the India Goods
    and Services Tax (GST) in the Project management and accounting modules,
    enhanced code-free configuration, and the ability to translate documentation
    (.docx and .html formats) by using Dynamics Translation Service (DTS).
