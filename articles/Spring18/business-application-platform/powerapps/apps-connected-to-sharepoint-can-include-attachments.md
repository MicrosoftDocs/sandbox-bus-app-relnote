#  Apps connected to SharePoint can include attachments




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Apps connected to a SharePoint list with attachments can now both read and write
attachments to the SharePoint site in PowerApps. Attachments appear in the data
source as a field that can be added to a form as part of a data card. Create
applications from scratch by using the attachment control as part of a data card
and reference attachments in a gallery.
