#  Azure Diagnostics




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Azure Diagnostics is the capability within Azure to collect diagnostic data on a
deployed application. The Azure Diagnostics extension can transfer this data to
an Azure storage account or send it to services like Application Insights. The
data can be used for debugging and troubleshooting, measuring performance,
monitoring resource usage, traffic analysis and capacity planning, and auditing.
Power BI Embedded is connected to Azure Diagnostics to enable the diagnostics of
the Power BI Embedded part along with other Azure resources used by the
application.
