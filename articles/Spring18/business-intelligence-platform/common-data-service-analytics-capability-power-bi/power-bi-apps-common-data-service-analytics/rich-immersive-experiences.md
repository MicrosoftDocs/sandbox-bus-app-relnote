#  Rich, immersive experiences 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI apps come with natural language query support. Users ask questions in
the app or in Cortana to get immediate insights.

If you want users to view their insights in context, embed your Power BI app
wherever you choose. Youâ€™ll be able to customize your reports and leverage
features like Q&A and Quick Insights.
