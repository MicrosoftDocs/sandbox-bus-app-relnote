Dynamics 365 for Marketing delivers comprehensive capabilities for creating and
running multi‑channel campaigns to generate leads for your sales team using
simple drag-and-drop design tools. The application includes event management,
lead management, embedded intelligence for segment targeting, lead scoring, and
interactions insights.

The marketing application is built on the same platform as Dynamics 365 for
Sales, so your marketing and sales teams share common information and business
processes to help them collaborate closely throughout the sales cycle.
