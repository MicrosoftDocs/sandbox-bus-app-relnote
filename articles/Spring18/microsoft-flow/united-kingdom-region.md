[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The United Kingdom region is now available for Microsoft Flow. This means that
you can create environments in the UK, and all the flow customer data will be
maintained solely within the UK. You can read more about our commitments to
storing data on the Microsoft Trust Center [page for Microsoft
Flow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/business-application-platform/data-location).
