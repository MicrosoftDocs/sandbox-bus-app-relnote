#  User experiences for Q&A in reports




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Report authors can enable Q&A experiences for report consumers with suggested
questions to start from. These same experiences are surfaced in the Power BI
Service, Power BI Embedded, and Cortana, so users can perform explorations with
a preferred client.
