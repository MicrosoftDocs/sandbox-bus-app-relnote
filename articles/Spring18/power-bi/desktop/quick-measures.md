#  Quick measures




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The quick measures feature is generally available, and it no longer requires the
feature to be turned on from the **Preview** tab in the **Options** dialog box.
Additionally, the date hierarchy in Power BI is no longer required for time
intelligence quick measures. Instead, you can use the **Date** field from your
own date table.
