#  Voice of the Customer analytics using Power BI 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Voice of the Customer Analytics content pack for Power BI enables
organizations to glean insights about surveys and responses. Administrators or
survey designers can track metrics, such as average Net Promoter Score (NPS),
average customer satisfaction (CSAT) score, and response ratio. The dashboard
and reports provide charts and analytics for survey questions, and allow users
to explore and analyze survey data.
