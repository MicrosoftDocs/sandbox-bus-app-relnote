#  Common Data Service for Analytics in Power BI (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Common Data Service for Analytics expands Power BI to provide a self-service
data lake of business entities stored and manipulated directly within the Power
BI Service. It combines the following:

-   **The common data model.** A standardized and extensible collection of
    schemas (entities, attributes, and relationships) to represent business data
    objects and activities with well-defined semantics, publicly published by
    Microsoft. Examples of entities include: Account, Business Unit, Case,
    Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Product, Product Category, Purchase Order, and
    so on.

-   **Federated storage for these entities.** These entities are stored within
    Power BI and across mounted Azure storage.

-   **The ability to create, populate, transform, and enrich these entities.**
    Using an evolution of the low-code/no-code Power Query experience, users can
    create, populate, transform, and enrich these entities.
