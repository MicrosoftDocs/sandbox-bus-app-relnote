#  Bookmarking




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Create bookmarks in the Power BI Service without first creating a bookmark in
Power BI Desktop. The Bookmarking feature is generally available, and it no
longer requires the feature to be turned on from the **Preview** tab in the
**Options** dialog box.
