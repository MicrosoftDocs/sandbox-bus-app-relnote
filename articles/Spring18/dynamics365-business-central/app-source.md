#  App Source




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Within DynamicsÂ 365 Business Central, you can find apps on App Source that bring
you more capabilities. If you're a developer, you can build powerful extensions
and then add them to App Source for easy discoverability. The April release
includes many improvements to the extensions technology, allowing partners to
extend, customize, and build solutions in an upgradable fashion, decoupled from
the base application.
