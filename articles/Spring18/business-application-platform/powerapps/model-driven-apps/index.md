#  Model-driven apps




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

In addition to the canvas app development that PowerApps has been known for,
which provides full visual control over the user experience of an app, PowerApps
now offers another choice for high-productivity app development. With
model‑driven applications, app developers can start building an app with their
data model instead. They can model entities and their associated business rules,
processes, forms, views, and dashboards. From this model, they can easily
generate immersive user experiences by using the app designer.

To get started with model‑driven apps, use designers to:

-   **Define your site map.** Model your app's navigation, pulling in only the
    subset of information your users need. Take advantage of multiple levels of
    hierarchy and the ability to reference external resources.

-   **Add dashboards.** Include model‑driven dashboards or embedded Power BI
    content within your app.

-   **Include entities and components.** Add specific forms, views, dashboards,
    and charts for targeted entities to craft your user experience.
