#  Translation Service enhancements




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

**Dynamics Translation Service (DTS)** allows ISVs and partners to translate
Dynamics solutions and products (ERP only) in existing and new languages, taking
advantage of their own linguistics assets and Microsoft linguistic assets. In
addition to supporting user interface (UI) translation, DTS now supports user
assistance (UA) translation in Microsoft Word and HTML formats (.docx, .html)
(Public Preview). Recycling capabilities from the latest Microsoft translations
have also been enhanced for UI and documentation translation projects.
