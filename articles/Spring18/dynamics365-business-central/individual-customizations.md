#  Individual customizations




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

You can personalize Dynamics 365 Business Central by, for example, adding or
removing fields. Use the embedded designer to customize the user interface by
moving fields or decluttering the experience.

As a partner, you can apply customizations to one or more of your customers
individually. You can apply the same changes to all your customers in
Dynamics 365 Business Central or give each of them the tweaks they need.
