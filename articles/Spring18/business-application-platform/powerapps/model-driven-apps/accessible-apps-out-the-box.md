#  Accessible apps out of the box




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Model-driven apps are metadata-driven. Core components of the user experience,
such as dashboards, lists, navigation, forms, and commands, are generated upon
creation of the entity. Standard components, such as charts, lists, and
controls, are built to Microsoft accessibility standards [(go to the Trust
Center to learn about our industryâ€‘leading accessibility
standards).](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/accessibility)
By default, any app built using these components is also accessible. The custom
control framework that controls are built on also provides accessibility hooks,
so that any new controls that are created can easily be made accessible.
