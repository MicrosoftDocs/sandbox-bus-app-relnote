#  Common Data Service for Analytics capability in Power BI




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Common Data Service for Analytics in Power BI integrates your organizationâ€™s
data with a standardized schema built on the Microsoft Common Data Model. It
also helps enrich your data with advanced analytics and simplified access to
machine learning to provide intelligent and actionable insights for your data.

Common Data Service for Analytics expands Power BI to provide a self-service
data lake of business entities stored and manipulated directly within the Power
BI Service. It combines the following:

-   **The common data model.** A standardized and extensible collection of
    schemas (entities, attributes, and relationships) to represent business data
    objects and activities with well-defined semantics, publicly published by
    Microsoft. Examples of entities include: Account, Business Unit, Case,
    Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Product, Product Category, Purchase Order, and
    so on.

-   **Federated storage for these entities.** These entities are stored within
    Power BI and across mounted Azure storage.

-   **The ability to create, populate, transform, and enrich these entities.**
    Using an evolution of the low-code/no-code Power Query experience, users can
    create, populate, transform, and enrich these entities.
