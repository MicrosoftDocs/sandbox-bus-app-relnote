# PowerShell commands library for the on-premises data gateway (Public Preview)

[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The on-premises data gateway PowerShell cmdlets are available in the [public
PowerShell
gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/OnPremisesDataGatewayMgmt/1.0.0-beta1).

Use the PowerShell commands to:

-   Retrieve the list of gateway clusters that are available for a user.

-   Retrieve the list of gateway instances registered in a cluster, and their
    online or offline status.

-   Modify the enable/disable status for a gateway instance within a cluster,
    and other gateway properties.

-   Delete a gateway.

To use the commands, you donâ€™t need to use the same computer where the gateway
is installed.
