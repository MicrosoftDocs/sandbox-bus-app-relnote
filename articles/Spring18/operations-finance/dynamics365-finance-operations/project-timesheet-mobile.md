Project timesheet is a mobile app that lets employees create and submit project
timesheets to record their hours for a specific project. Employees can create a
new timesheet from scratch or copy data from an existing timesheet to ensure
rapid, accurate time entry. If an employee is designated as a delegate, he or
she can also enter a timesheet for another worker. The app lets employees filter
by project, resource, or approval status to quickly locate and select a
timesheet. Employees can also save favorites, which saves the project and
activity information on the timesheet. The saved favorites can be used to create
future timesheets, speeding the time entry process. Project timesheet can be
accessed via the web browser on a mobile device.
