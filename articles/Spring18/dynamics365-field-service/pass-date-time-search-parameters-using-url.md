#  Pass in the date and time for search parameters by using the URL




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Previously, when creating dynamic searches by using URLs, you could pass in the
search date range but not the specific time of the search on each day. For
example, you could indicate that you need a resource between April 1 and April
3, but you couldnâ€™t indicate that a resource was needed between April 1 at 8 AM
and April 3 at 5 PM. Now, you can specify a date and a time for the search
beginning and end. [See this blog for related details about building searches
dynamically with
