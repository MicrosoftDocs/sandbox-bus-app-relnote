#  Persistent filters




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users expect continuity in the work. Therefore, when visiting a report in
mobile, they expect to have the same view of data and continue data
investigation from where they left it before, no matter if this work was done in
mobile or on web. With persistent filters, Power BI saves each userâ€™s slicer and
filter values, and automatically applies them when users return to view the
reports.
