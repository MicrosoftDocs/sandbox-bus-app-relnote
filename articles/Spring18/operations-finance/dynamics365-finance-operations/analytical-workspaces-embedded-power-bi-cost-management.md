#  Analytical workspaces with embedded Power BI for Cost management




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

If you are an Operations Manager or a cost accountant who wants to optimize your
supply chain performance as well as manage costs, Analytical workspaces in Cost
management provide you with the deep insights necessary for your role. You can
get a bird’s eye view of your inventory and the associated costs by location or
by product category. You can dive deeper into trouble spots and take action
without leaving Finance and Operations.

New Analytical workspaces for Cost management are embedded in the Cost
administration and Cost Analysis workspaces. The content pack includes measures
such as beginning balance, ending balance, net sourcing and net usage. A set of
calculated measures, such as inventory turn ratio, days inventory on-hand, and
inventory accuracy are also included.

A new category hierarchy role named Cost management has been implemented. The
hierarchies assigned to this role are made available for reporting in the Cost
management Power BI content. The category hierarchies should be considered as an
alternative to Item group.

The Cost administration workspace provides a bird's-eye view of

-   Overview (Application data)

-   Inventory accounting status (Embedded Power BI)

-   Manufacturing accounting status (Embedded Power BI)
