#  Get data APIs 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can interact with visuals embedded within an application by setting
filters or cross-referencing from other visuals in the report. To make analytics
an integrated part of the application and the application business logic, you
can extract data displayed in the visual using APIs. The application can get
this data and trigger application business logic based on data that is
meaningful for the application user in this context.
