#  Dynamics 365 for Customer Service




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Spring ’18 release delivers investments in user experience, performance,
developer productivity, and compliance across the Customer Service Hub,
Dynamics 365 Portal, Voice of the Customer (VoC), and Unified Service Desk.

Key investments include:

**Customer Service Hub application for case and knowledge management.** Built on
the Unified Interface framework, the Customer Service Hub is a focused and
intuitive application for case and knowledge management on any screen size,
device, or orientation.



**Dynamics 365 Portal can be used to create cloud-hosted web portals for
external audiences.** Dynamics 365 Portal allows search within attachments, and
includes improved debugging for developers.

**Unified Service Desk for consolidated communication channels on a single
interface.** The Spring ’18 release includes a Best practice analyzer that
analyzes customizations and identifies defects to help with building and
deploying efficient customizations and extensions. Customizers can also host
Customer Service Hub pages and integrate business process flows within Unified
Service Desk (Public Preview only).

**Voice of the Customer enhancements for survey-creation and feedback
analysis.** Voice of the Customer includes cascade deletion of surveys, survey
translation enhancements, the ability to dynamically insert question responses
into subsequent questions, and improved analytics capabilities with the Voice of
the Customer Analytics content pack for Power BI.
