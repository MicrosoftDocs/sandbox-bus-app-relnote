#  Gauge (Public Preview)


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Gauge lets hiring managers or recruiters create questionnaires and send them to
candidates as part of an assessment activity. Candidates are informed in their
candidate app that a new task is waiting for them. They can easily navigate to
the questionnaire and complete the assessment. The hiring manager and recruiter
can track the process and results directly in Attract.
