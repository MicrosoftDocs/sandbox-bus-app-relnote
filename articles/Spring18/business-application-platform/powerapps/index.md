#  PowerApps




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

PowerApps is the high-productivity application development platform from
Microsoft. In this release, we’re combining the richness of Dynamics 365 with
the agility of PowerApps to create a single unified platform. The PowerApps
platform is now the platform that the Dynamics 365 for Sales, Service,
Marketing, and Talent applications are natively built on. This release also
includes major advancements to the Common Data Service for Apps (the data
platform that comes with PowerApps) and client UX creation tools. These new
capabilities are backward-compatible with the Dynamics 365 platform (frequently
called the xRM platform), which means that Dynamics 365 customizers and partners
can use already-acquired skills to create apps with PowerApps.



PowerApps is also tightly integrated with Office 365. You can use the same set
of tools to customize and extend an increasing number of Office 365 apps and
build standalone business applications connected to more than 200 data sources.
You can now build two types of applications with PowerApps: model‑driven apps
and canvas apps.

New capabilities include:

-   **Model-driven apps.** You can build a new type of application with
    PowerApps: model‑driven apps. Create and customize model‑driven apps
    directly from PowerApps.com by using the app designer. Bring together
    entities, forms, views, dashboards, charts, and business processes to
    automatically generate powerful line-of-business applications. It's easy to
    get started building model‑driven apps. Switch to model‑driven mode, learn
    the basics, and then explore one of our great sample apps.

-   **Entity forms.** Create and customize sophisticated forms for Common Data
    Service for Apps entities directly from model‑driven mode on PowerApps.com.
    Create forms with visual drag-and-drop designers by using a host of custom
    controls that are available from a rich control library. 

-   **Entity views.** Create and customize views for Common Data Service for
    Apps entities directly from model‑driven mode on PowerApps.com. Use
    point-and-click tools to create filters, set the sort order, and choose
    which columns to display.

-   **Business process flows.** Associate one or more business process flows
    with your model‑driven app to focus your users' experience through a
    specific set of guided steps.

-   **Dashboards.** Build and use custom interactive dashboards with rich chart
    controls that use data from Common Data Service for Apps entities. Embed
    Power BI dashboards in model‑driven application dashboards for deeper
    cross-system data analysis directly from the application.

-   **Metadata-driven responsive user experiences.** Model-driven application
    user experiences are automatically generated upon entity creation. A
    navigation model, basic forms, and a subset of views are available for
    customization. User experiences are responsive and metadata-driven.
    Applications provide consistent functionality across all surfaces, including
    web and mobile and support for right-to-left (RTL) languages.

-   **Accessible apps out of the box.** Model-driven apps built using the
    Unified Interface infrastructure meet Microsoft accessibility standards
    [(g.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/accessibility)
    The applications enable users, including keyboard-only users and touch-only
    users, to perform key tasks. The apps work well with screen readers and
    won’t block other accessibility tools, such as one-click devices.

-   **Mobile player.** Run model‑driven apps on mobile devices. For tablets and
    phones, applications are automatically optimized for the device.

-   **Canvas apps.** The term “canvas apps” refers to apps built through the
    WYSIWYG screen design that provides complete control over the interface.
    With a canvas app, you start with a blank canvas to create a very tailored
    user interface. Then you connect that user interface to your choice of 200
    data sources. You can build canvas apps for web, mobile, and tablet
    applications. With a model-driven app, you start with your data model. Build
    from your core business data and processes in the Common Data Service for
    Apps to model forms, views, and other components. Model-driven apps
    automatically generate a great user interface that’s responsive across
    devices.

-   **Controllable delegation limits.** Control delegation limits for
    non-delegable data sources that have up to a maximum of 2,000 records. This
    allows client-side operations to work on larger datasets.

-   **SQL views.** To avoid performance issues, use SQL views to combine data in
    SQL Server before bringing it into PowerApps.

-   **Simplified access to entities through foreign key relationships.**
    Intuitive access to entities included in a relationship (foreign key) in
    entities that are stored in the Common Data Service for Apps makes it
    significantly easier to use related entities in canvas apps.

-   **Improved app sharing experience.** The improved experience for canvas apps
    makes it easier to view the data sources used by an app and easier to set up
    user permissions to access that data. For model‑driven apps, share apps by
    assigning appropriate security roles that provide user access to the
    entities and data in the Common Data Service for Apps.



-   **Apps connected to SharePoint lists can include attachments.** Apps
    connected to SharePoint Online can now be used to view and upload
    attachments, including images and documents.

-   **Improved support ticketing for admins.** Request help from a Microsoft
    support representative from the new Business platform admin center.

-   **GDPR compliance.** To support the EU's General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR), administrators can support data subject rights requests for
    PowerApps users.

-   **Automate governance with PowerShell.** The administrative capabilities of
    the Admin Center are now available programmatically to admins through the
    release of the PowerApps PowerShell cmdlets.
