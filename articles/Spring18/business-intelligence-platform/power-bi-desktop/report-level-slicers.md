#  Report level slicers




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Report authors can use slicers that sync across pages, and update visuals across
a report. This capability allows for dynamic navigation without losing context
when switching from page to page. Report authors can take control of filtering
in their report and customize it to meet user needs.
