#  Integration with Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation (Private Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution
uses the data integrator feature to synchronize data across instances of Finance
and Operations and Project Service Automation via the Common Data Service (CDS).
Integration templates that are available with the data integrator feature enable
the flow of projects, project contracts, and project contract lines from Project
Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

**Note:** Before you can integrate Project Service Automation with Finance and
Operations, you must configure the Project Service Automation integration
parameters.

This integration solution enables direct synchronization in the following
scenarios:

-   Maintain project contracts in Project Service Automation and synchronize
    them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

-   Create projects in Project Service Automation and synchronize them directly
    from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

-   Maintain project contract lines in Project Service Automation and
    synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance and
    Operations.

-   Maintain project contract line milestones in Project Service Automation and
    synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance and
    Operations.

-   Maintain project tasks in Project Service Automation and synchronize them
    directly from Project Service Automaton to Finance and Operations.

-   Synchronize project expense categories between Finance and Operations and
    Project Service Automation.

-   Create hour estimates in Project Service Automation and synchronize them
    directly from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations project
    hour forecasts.

-   Create expense estimates in Project Service Automation and synchronize them
    directly from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations project
    expense forecasts.

-   Create actuals in Project Service Automation and synchronize them directly
    from Project Service Automation to the Finance and Operations integration
    journal where the accounting will be applied and the project transactions
    are posted. Synchronization of information back to Project Service
    Automation, such as the voucher number and any sales tax calculated in
    Finance and Operations will also be provided as a template.

Not all templates are currently available. Templates will be released as they
are completed. Additional phased releases will provide templates for
synchronizing:

-   Expense reports.

-   Work breakdown structure.

-   Billing.

-   Purchase orders.

The following illustration shows how data is synchronized as part of the
integration between Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations.
