#  Advanced interview scheduling




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Advanced interview scheduling makes it easier to manage multi-day interviews,
handle last-minute interviewer replacement, and provide improved communication
throughout the scheduling process. It supports customers with more complex
requirements and provides additional options in the automated scheduling engine.
New capabilities include:

-   Scheduler role that provides the ability to:

-   View interview accept/decline notifications in Attract.

-   Create an interview schedule in just a few clicks.

-   Propose alternate interview times.

-   Cancel, propose, or notify the recruiter/hiring manager about interview
    schedule changes.

-   Propose a list of interview time slots to candidates.

The interview scheduler might be a recruiter or hiring manager. They can use a
scheduling wizard to create an interview schedule for a candidate in just a few
clicks. The suggested schedule can be modified and extended with one or more
interview slots, and each slot can have one or multiple interviewers. The
scheduler can set an individual start time and duration for each interview slot,
provide details about that slot, and include a conference room. After the
interview schedule is completed, the scheduler sends invitations to
interviewers. The status that indicates whether the interviewer accepted or
declined can be tracked, and the scheduler can decide at any point to share the
schedule with the candidate.
