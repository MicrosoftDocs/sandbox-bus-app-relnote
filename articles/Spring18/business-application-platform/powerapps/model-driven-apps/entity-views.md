#  Entity views 




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Model-driven views make it easy for citizen developers and users to quickly
define custom views for a set of records on any entity.

Entity views include the following features: Â 

-   Create filters with sophisticated conditional logic by using drag-and-drop
    operations.

-   Show or hide columns and set the sort order.

-   Provide visual snapshots through entity charts. Users can interactively
    create a subset of the underlying view for a chart.

-   Users can create their own personal views.

[For more information about entity views, go to Create and edit public or system
views by using the app
designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/form-editor-user-interface-legacy).
