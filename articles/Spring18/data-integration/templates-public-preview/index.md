#  Templates (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Starting in April, you can use the Salesforce.com, Field Service Integration,
and Project Service Integration templates as a starting point to help map
entities and fields from source to destination. You can customize these
templates with custom entities and field mappings to fit your specific business
needs.
