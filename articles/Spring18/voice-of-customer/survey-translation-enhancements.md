#  Survey translation enhancements




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Survey translation files are validated for any missing translated strings or
incorrect HTML formatting when a survey is previewed or published. Error logs
identify which strings in the translation file have issues. Users are able to
translate the survey link text in the invitation email to personalize it for the
respondentâ€™s locale by providing the language as input in the survey snippet.
