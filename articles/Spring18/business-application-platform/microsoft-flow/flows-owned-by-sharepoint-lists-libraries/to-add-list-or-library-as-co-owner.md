For a flow that uses a SharePoint action (for example, when an item is added or
modified):

1.  Select the flow in the **My flows** or **Teams flows** list.

2.  On the flow details page, select the **Add another owner** button.

3.  Go to the **SharePoint** tab.

4.  Select the site address and list ID of the list you want to share the flow
    with, and then select **Share**.

List members can navigate to the flow by selecting it on the menu in SharePoint.
