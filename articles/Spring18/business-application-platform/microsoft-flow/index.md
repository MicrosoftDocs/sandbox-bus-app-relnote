#  Microsoft Flow




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft is modernizing business processes across productivity, CRM, and ERP
applications, which makes it easier for every business to transform how people
work. Microsoft Flow, the Microsoft workflow and business process management
platform, is core to the success of this mission. It's the connective glue
that’s used by users and app developers alike for digital transformation, no
matter what application they’re using. Flow, together with PowerApps and Power
BI, makes up the Business application platform.

New capabilities for Flow in the Spring ’18 release include:

-   **Create a business process flow.** A business process flow is a new type of
    stateful, human-interactive flow based on the Common Data Service for Apps.
    Use these new flows to define a set of stages and steps for people to
    follow. They can move forward and backward as needed.

-   **Business process flow entity customization.** Business process flow
    entities can appear in the system, so that entity record data can be made
    available in grids, views, charts, and dashboards.

-   **Add an action to a business process flow.** In a business process flow,
    add a button that triggers an action or workflow that runs processes on your
    data.

-   **Repair recommendations sent in email for failed flows.** If a flow fails,
    have detailed repair recommendations sent right to your inbox. These
    step-by-step recommendations are linked directly to the information you need
    to fix the most common failures.

-   **Request for sign-off flow built into SharePoint.** When you select a file
    or item in SharePoint, you’ll see a new Request for sign-off flow. This
    flow, which doesn't require any configuration or setup, sends a sign-off
    request with a single click.

-   **Customize SharePoint content approvals with Flow.** For SharePoint page
    libraries, site administrators can take advantage of Flow for content
    approval workflows.

-   **Flows “owned by” SharePoint lists and libraries.** Flows that work with
    SharePoint lists (and libraries) can be shared with those lists, so instead
    of being shared with individuals or groups, they’re shared with everyone who
    has access to the list. As membership of the list or library changes, users
    are automatically given access to the flow.

-   **Test your flow by using sample data.** Creating a flow might require some
    trial and error during the development process. Use sample data to test your
    flow as you build it, so you know that the flow will run as expected.

-   **Build and run flows from Excel.** With the new Flow button (accessed from
    the ribbon’s Data tab), you can create and trigger automations from Flow on
    your table data in Excel. Automate data processing or the copying/importing
    of data.

-   **Create a flow for Microsoft To-Do in Outlook Web App.** If someone is
    \@mentioned in Outlook Web App, they’ll see a shortcut to create a flow.
    This flow automatically creates tasks for the \@mentioned person in
    Microsoft To-Do, based on the content of the email.

-   **Return data to PowerApps from a flow.** Build flows that can be called
    from an app built with PowerApps, and return data back to the app. Use the
    visual drag-and-drop flow designer to build the logic you need for the app.

-   **Quick access to help and support.** Open support tickets in the context of
    an issue encountered in Flow, such as when your workflow is failing.
    Automatically provide Microsoft support engineers with failure details for
    quicker resolution.

-   **GDPR compliance.** To support the EU's General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR), administrators can now submit a request to export or delete all of
    the data about Flow users.

-   **Access modern approvals in the Common Data Service for Apps.** Modern
    approvals data in Flow is built on the latest version of the Common Data
    Service for Apps. This means that you can build flows that read the status
    of the approvals you send or receive with the CDS connector.

-   **Find errors in “apply to each” action.** Jump directly to errors in loops
    in the flow run view, even when there are hundreds of items in the loop.

-   **Reassign approvals.** Assign any approval you receive to another person in
    your organization to delegate the approval.

-   **See details of flow buttons.** When you run a flow that has been shared
    with you, see all the actions that the flow uses.

-   **United Kingdom region.** Create environments to store data in the United
    Kingdom.

-   **New documentation landing page.** On the documentation landing page, group
    content by skill level: beginner, intermediate user, or expert.

-   **Add multiple records to array inputs.** Use a list builder for adding
    multiple attachments to an email, for example.

-   **Test flows with previous run data.** Test your flow with trigger data from
    previous flow runs by using a Test flow button in the designer.

-   **Access flow details with the workflow() expression.** Access the
    environment name and flow display name with the workflow() expression.
