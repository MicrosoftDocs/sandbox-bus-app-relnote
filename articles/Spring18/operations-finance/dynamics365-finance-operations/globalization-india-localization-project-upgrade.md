#  Globalization – India localization: Project and upgrade




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Project localization for India lets users manage Indian Goods and Services Tax
(GST) for the Project management and accounting module.

-   Maintain Indian GST information in project contracts, project categories,
    and so on.

-   Calculate GST by using a configurable Global Tax Engine (GTE) for all
    tax-relevant project transactions, such as project quotations, expense
    journals, hour journals, item journals, fee journals, on-account
    transactions, project invoice proposals, and service management.

-   Print Tax invoice for project

Localization upgrade for India lets current Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 customers
upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
