#  Rehire flag




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

When completing the termination process, workers can now be flagged if they are
eligible for rehire. If the employee is flagged as not eligible for rehire, he
or she won't be included in the skill mapping process. The flag is also visible
in the Past workers list.
