#  Display more on the schedule board by adjusting the scale




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can adjust the scale of the schedule board to decrease the width of the
columns. In this way, they can view a wider date range. Whether you’re viewing
the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly board, you’ll see a scale control at the
bottom of the screen.
