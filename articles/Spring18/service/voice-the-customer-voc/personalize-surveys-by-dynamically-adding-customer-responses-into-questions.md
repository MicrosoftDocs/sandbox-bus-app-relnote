#  Personalize surveys by dynamically adding customer responses into questions 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Personalize a survey by inserting the response to a question into subsequent
questions and response option texts, using the Answer Tag field. When building
the survey, provide a value for the Answer Tag for the first question, and then
use the same value in the subsequent questions.
