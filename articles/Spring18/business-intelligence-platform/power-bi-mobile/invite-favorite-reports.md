#  Invite and favorite reports




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can share reports from the mobile app, similar to the way they share
dashboards.

The report sharing feature works just like the dashboard sharing feature but
allows you to directly share a report. The new sharing pane opens for a report,
which allows you to give access right to the report and send invites to the
users you add. When you share the report with your colleagues, it appears in
their [Shared with
me](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-shared-with-me) list, on
the web and in the mobile app.

The **Invite** option is available on the action bar of the report. You can
share reports in your personal workspace or in an app workspace that you’re a
member of. You can also share reports if the owner gives you re-share
permissions.

When you select **Invite**, the **Invite a colleague** pane appears. You’ll
notice that it has the same capabilities as for dashboards. When you share the
report, it shares both the report and the underlying dataset. It doesn’t change
any row-level security setting for the dataset, so the recipient sees only the
data that they’re authorized to view.
