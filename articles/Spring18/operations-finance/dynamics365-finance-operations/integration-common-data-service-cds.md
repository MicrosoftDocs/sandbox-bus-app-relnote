[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations has enabled cross-application business
processes between Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 for Field Service and
between Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation.
These scenarios are configured using extensible Data integrator templates and
CDS to enable the cross application scenarios. To learn more about CDS, see
[Common Data Service for Apps](../../business-application-platform/common-data-service-apps/index.md).
