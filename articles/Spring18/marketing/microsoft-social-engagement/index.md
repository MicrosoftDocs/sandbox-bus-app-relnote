#  Microsoft Social Engagement




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Social Engagement allows organizations to listen for keywords and
phrases on social media to help them understand customer sentiment and engage in
conversations about their products and brand.

Social Engagement is included at no additional cost with subscriptions to the
Dynamics 365 Plan, Customer Engagement Plan, and customer engagement
applications (Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, and Project
Service). 10,000 social posts per month are included, with the option to
purchase additional social post quota packages as needed.

Social Engagement includes four categories of capabilities: social insights,
brand reputation, social care, and social selling.

-   **Social insights** offers interactive analytics for social media
    conversations, such as native-language-based sentiment analysis across a
    broad set of sources. Identify the most important conversations using unique
    adaptive sentiment and intention analysis capabilities. Quickly set up
    searches and track the right content (updated in near real-time).

-   **Brand reputation** helps marketers and public relations professionals
    understand social media conversations about products and services and can be
    tailored to each organization's unique brand needs. Use intelligent alerts
    to stay ahead of any potential public relations crisis and receive
    notifications when significant changes on social media are detected.
    Companies can grow and engage their social media communities by identifying,
    tracking, and connecting with brand influencers and industry experts.

-   **Social care** lets customer service organizations or community managers
    engage with their customers on social media. Use automation rules to
    intelligently assign social posts to the right people for follow-up, or to
    create cases in Dynamics 365.

-   **Social selling** helps sellers build their social presence and credibility
    by providing intelligent and personalized recommendations about their
    company, brands, services, and products. The Social Selling Assistant lets
    people share these recommendations with their social networks, which
    underlines their social presence and eventually helps them find more leads
    and close more deals.
