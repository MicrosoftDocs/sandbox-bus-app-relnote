#  Visio custom visuals




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

You can use the Visio custom visual to visualize data using Microsoft Visio
diagrams from within Power BI dashboards and reports. With this new visual, you
can connect to a Visio diagram hosted on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business.
The underlying Power BI data is then automatically and intelligently linked to
the diagram based on its shape properties, eliminating the need to do this
manually.
