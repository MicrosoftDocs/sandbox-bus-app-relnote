#  Globalization: Retail localization for India




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Retailers in India need to be able to calculate Goods and Services Tax (GST) in
their POS solutions, and to post GST in Retail headquarters. Dynamics 365 for
Retail was integrated with Global Tax Engine (GTE) to support GST calculation in
POS. Both intrastate GST and interstate GST can be calculated, depending on the
customer delivery location. GST integration is supported for normal sales and
return transactions, and also for customer orders and replenishment operations.
Dynamics 365 for Retail POS also supports the calculation of value-added tax
(VAT) if it's required. In addition, for named customers, invoice numbers can be
populated from POS receipt numbers.

Some sample transactions that are possible with this new functionality include:

-   Sell to a registered customer.

-   Sell taxable goods to a consumer.

-   Sell taxable goods to an anonymous customer where GST is price-inclusive.

-   Sell an exempted good.

-   Return a transaction that has GST.
