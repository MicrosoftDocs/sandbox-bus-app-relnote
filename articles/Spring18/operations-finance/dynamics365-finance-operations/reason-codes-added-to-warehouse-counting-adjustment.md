#  Reason codes added to warehouse counting and adjustment




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

It’s now possible to add a reason code when performing counts and when making an
adjustment. This allows the warehouse manager and the controller to have a
better understanding of the distribution of an event and to take appropriate
measures. Reason codes are implemented in counting journals for Warehouse and on
a mobile device. The following functions will be available:

-   Post-counting journals as per standard Finance and Operations functionality

-   Cycle count

-   Spot count

-   Threshold count

-   Adjustment in

-   Adjustment out
