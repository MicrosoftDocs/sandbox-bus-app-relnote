#  Dashboards 




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Create rich, interactive dashboards to visualize data from the Common Data
Service for Apps inside a model‑driven application.

The drag-and-drop designer simplifies the dashboard creation process for:

-   Homepage dashboards that include charts and lists from multiple entities.

-   Entity-specific interactive dashboards that allow visual filtering and
    sorting of information.

Include rich Power BI capabilities directly inside model‑driven apps by
embedding Power BI dashboards in home pages. Dashboards can include data from
any source, including the Common Data Service for Apps.
