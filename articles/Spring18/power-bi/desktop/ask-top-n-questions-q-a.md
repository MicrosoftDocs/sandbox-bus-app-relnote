#  Ask Top N questions in Q&A




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Use ad hoc analysis in Q&A to ask Top N questions, such as “What are my top 10
customers by sales?” Users can ask these questions in Power BI Desktop when
authoring a visual, in the Power BI Service while viewing a dashboard, or on
mobile using voice.
