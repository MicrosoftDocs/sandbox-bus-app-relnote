#  Single visual embedding




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

By embedding visuals into your application, users can get in-page analytics
where the most relevant and insightful data resides, facilitating data-driven
decisions.

The flexible API gives the capability to choose which visual to show for each
user, or switch visuals in the same iFrame during the userâ€™s session. The
developer can optimize the size and layout of each visual at any time using the
custom layout feature.

Unlike tile embedding, to embed a visual, the developer specifies the report and
report page for the visual. From the list of visuals in a page, the developer
can define the visuals that will be hidden and visible. This methodology has a
few advantages:

-   **Switching visuals.** By switching visuals on the same report, there is no
    need to generate a new embed token. Switch the visibility definition of the
    visuals and immediately different visuals already rendered, are displayed.

-   **Displaying multiple visuals**. Why settle for a single visual, if you need
    more than one to gain insights? As you define the visibility of each visual,
    you can choose to show multiple visuals on the same iFrame and define in
    real time the size and position of each one. By showing multiple visuals,
    you also enjoy interactivity and cross-filtering between visuals, just like
    a regular report.
