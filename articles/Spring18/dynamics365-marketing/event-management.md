#  Event management




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The Marketing application features comprehensive event management, which helps
you plan, execute, promote, and follow-up on webinars and in-person events.
Start your planning by modeling your venue, booking speakers, collecting
sponsors, and setting up your event schedule. Then publish your event details
directly to the event portal, where attendees can read about the event, view
speaker bios, register online, and build their session schedule. Finally, set up
a customer journey to promote the event, collect registrations, and follow up
with attendees.
