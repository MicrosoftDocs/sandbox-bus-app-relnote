#  Manager self-service




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Spring '18 updates provide managers with increased productivity and efficiency
by expanding self-service options. Managers can initiate compensation changes
and provide justification for them. The system then provides a workflow so HR
can review and approve changes and ensure they are accurate and within budget.
