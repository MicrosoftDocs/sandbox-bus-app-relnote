#  Dynamics 365 for Talent – Core HR




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Spring ‘18 release of Talent - Core HR focuses on General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) compliance, enabling integrations, and adding key capabilities
based on customer feedback.

To support best-of-breed payroll functionality and increase the portfolio of
customers we can support, we have added payroll integration capabilities,
including support for Ceridian Dayforce. In addition, we provide support for
open enrollment processing and streamlined processing for employees to initiate
qualified life event changes. These updates provide configuration and processing
of all changes, together with a workflow to ensure accurate data across Talent
for compliance and eligibility, and the ability to export elections to benefits
providers.

Enhanced manager self-service capabilities mean that managers can initiate
compensation change processes within their organizations. Integrated review and
workflow approval processes ensure that changes are accurate and within budget.

We have integrations with Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations to provide
initial data load into Talent to support customers’ migrations. We also provide
ongoing integration to maintain Finance and Operations workflows and Human
resources (HR) transactions. These integrations let existing Finance and
Operations customers migrate to Dynamics 365 for Talent. They also let customers
use Finance and Operations and Talent in concert.
