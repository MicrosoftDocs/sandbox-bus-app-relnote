#  Modern developer experience




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

By using Visual Studio Code, you can build powerful extensions in a modern
file-based development environment and language. All-new language capabilities
are included for easy integration with Microsoft Azure services such as Azure
Functions.

You can use the DynamicsÂ 365 Business Central business API with 44 entities for
easy, flexible, and fast interoperability with third-party solutions.
