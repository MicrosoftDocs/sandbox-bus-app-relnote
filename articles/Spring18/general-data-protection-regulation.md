#  General Data Protection Regulation




[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), takes effect. The GDPR imposes rules on companies, government agencies,
non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in
the EU, or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents. The GDPR applies
no matter where you are located.

Microsoft has extensive expertise in protecting data, championing privacy, and
complying with complex regulations, and currently complies with both EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield and EU Model Clauses.

We believe that the GDPR is an important step forward for clarifying and
enabling individual privacy rights. We want to help you focus on your core
business while efficiently preparing for the GDPR.
