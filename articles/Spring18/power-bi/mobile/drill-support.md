#  Drill-through support




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Supporting drill-through in mobile using the new tooltip platform. Users can use
drill‑through to navigate from one report page to another report page filtered
by selected entity. This is defined in Power BI Desktop. After drill‑through is
defined for a report page, the user can also use it in the mobile app by using
the drill‑through option in their tooltip menu.
