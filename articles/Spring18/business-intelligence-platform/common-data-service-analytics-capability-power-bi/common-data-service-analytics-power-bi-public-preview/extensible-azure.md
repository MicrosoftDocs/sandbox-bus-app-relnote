#  Extensible through Azure




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Common Data Service for Analytics storage is open, which means you can leverage
the Azure data stack to make data available to Common Data Service for Analytics
by bringing your own Azure Blob storage with Common Data Service for Analytics
entities. Mapped entities are available through Power BI and Power BI Desktop,
so they can be used by deployed Power BI apps, and you can use them to build
datasets, reports, and dashboards.

Common Data Service for Analytics will be available with Power BI Pro, Power BI
Premium, and Power BI Embedded.
