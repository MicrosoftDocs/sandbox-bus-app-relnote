#  Canvas apps support storing up to 20 MB of data locally on Android and iOS




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Apps that use the SaveData and LoadData functions to build offline-enabled apps
on PowerApps can now save up to 20 MB of data in a single SaveData/LoadData
call. This should enable common use cases, such as offline capture of images
that are later uploaded to the service.
