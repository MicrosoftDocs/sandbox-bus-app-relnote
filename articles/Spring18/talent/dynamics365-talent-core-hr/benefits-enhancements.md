-   **Benefits open enrollment**. Benefits open enrollment provides employees
    with an easy-to-follow, self-service experience for selecting their
    benefits. Human resource administrators can configure their organizationâ€™s
    benefits open enrollment process. They can also design the employee
    enrollment experience using a guided solution. Employee benefit enrollment
    elections can then be exported and sent to benefit providers.
