#  Software Development Kit (SDK)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The SDK includes an architectural overview of the Common Data Service for Apps,
the entity model, security model, and web services. Sample code and walkthroughs
are provided to guide you through the features.

It also contains information that developers can use to customize components
within the Common Data Service for Apps through code.

**Note:** If you used the Preview of the SDK for the previous version of the
Common Data Service, you’ll find that the new SDK (which is the version
available for Dynamics 365) offers significant changes. The previous SDK will
remain in Preview. Any apps using that SDK will have to be updated to work
against the new SDK.

Developers can use the SDK to create and customize:

-   Entities (including fields and views).

-   Charts and dashboards.

-   Business processes.

-   Virtual entities.

The SDK can also be used for more advanced scenarios, including:

-   Plug-ins, Azure extensions, and webhooks.

-   Code-based data generation and import.

-   Solution creation and management (ALM).
