#  Dynamics 365 for Retail




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The focus of the Spring ‘18 release for Retail includes an investment in service
hardening and enabling new capabilities that drive our integrated and
omni-channel value proposition even further. Specifically, our investments
enhance customers’ ability to:

-   Work in a performant, scalable, and reliable cloud service that has better
    telemetry, diagnostics, and alerting. With this system, customer issues can
    be quickly and proactively analyzed and resolved.

-   Manage customizations by using extensions. With a fully hard-sealed
    environment, customers should experience a significant reduction in the time
    and cost of servicing.

-   Reconcile financials by using improved integrated end-of-day processing
    capabilities. Customers should experience improved performance and processes
    that are easier to understand.

-   Process payments with faster and more secure transaction processing.
    Customers should experience better coverage and reliability. We have also
    made it easier to understand and recover from hardware, network, and
    back-end processing failures.

-   Manage data distribution across distributed channels. Customers can more
    effectively manage network disruptions, using offline capabilities that are
    easy to administer and use.

-   Operate retail stores on a 24/7 basis with greater predictability. We have
    introduced enhancements to support the goal of zero downtime during software
    updates and the separation of front-office and back-office processes through
    Retail Cloud Scale Unit. With this, Retail can scale more effectively to
    seasonal and on-demand needs.
