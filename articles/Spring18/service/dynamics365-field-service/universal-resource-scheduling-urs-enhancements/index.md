Universal Resource Scheduling (URS) provides scheduling capabilities for the
Customer Service, Field Service, and Project Service apps. Additionally, the
solution can be configured to schedule any entity in the system.

The capabilities included here were introduced in Universal Resource Scheduling
solution (version 2.4.1.x), Field Service application (version 7.4.1.x), and
Project Service Automation application (version 2.4.1.x), and run on platform
version 9.0.x. [For more details about the capabilities, see this blog post from

URS solution, your organization already has these features.
