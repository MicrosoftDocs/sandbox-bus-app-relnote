#  Flows “owned by” SharePoint lists and libraries




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Until recently, flows could be shared only with individuals or Azure Active
Directory security groups. Now, flows that use SharePoint lists or libraries can
be shared with those lists or libraries. This means that if new members are
added to the list or removed, their access to the flow changes accordingly.
Sharing comes in two flavors: you can add a list as a co-owner or as a run-only
user. When you add a list as a co-owner, all members of the list have full
access to the flow. They can edit the flow, delete it, or share it with others.
When you add a list as a run-only user, all members of the list can only run the
flow.
