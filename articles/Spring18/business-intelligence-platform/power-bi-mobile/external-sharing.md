#  External sharing




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can share reports and dashboards with users external to their tenant. This
can be users from other Azure AD tenants, or with recipients who have email
addresses from popular consumer email services and telecommunications providers
directly from their mobile app.

The app displays a warning message to inform the user that they are going to
share the artifact with an external user, and seeks approval before sending the
invite to the external recipients.
