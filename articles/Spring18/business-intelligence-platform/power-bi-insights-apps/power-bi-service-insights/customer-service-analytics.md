#  Customer Service Analytics


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Customer Service Analytics reports provide case analytics to the service
manager about cases opened, resolved, and escalated, as well as key performance
indicators (KPIs) for service level agreement (SLA) violations. The reports also
provide insights about customer satisfaction and survey responses.

The reports help answer questions like:

-   Which service engineers resolve the highest number of cases?

-   What is the service teamâ€™s average case duration?
