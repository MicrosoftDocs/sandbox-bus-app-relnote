#  On-premises deployment updates




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

In the Spring '18 release timeframe, releases (for new deployments) include:

-   Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.2 with
    Platform Update 12 (on-premises).

-   [Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition
    7.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/whats-new-application-7.3-update)
    with Platform Update 15 (on-premises).

-   Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations 8.0 with Platform Update 16
    (on-premises).

Additional on-premises-specific features are listed below.

-   **Setup and deployment.** Improvements to setup and deployment greatly
    reduce the time to set up infrastructure. Increased automation and added
    multiple prerequisite checks improve reliability. For more information, see
    the most current [setup
    instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-environments).

-   **Servicing.** After deployment, on-premises customers can apply
    Microsoft-released platform and application updates, and also code
    customizations, to their environment through Lifecycle Services. This lets
    customers stay current with the latest set of fixes and take new
    customizations without having to reconfigure an existing environment or
    redeploy the on-premises environment. Customers can roll back code changes
    if package application fails. Note that the [reconfigure
    feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment)
    will remain available for environments deployed with Platform update
    versions earlier than Platform update 12. 

-   **Disconnected client experiences.** You can disable experiences that depend
    on internet connectivity on the client machine, even when the client is
    connected to the internet, by using a simple configuration update from the
    application.

-   **Data management.** The ability to import and export data in Data
    management via integration APIs is available for on-premises deployments.
    This functionality lets you integrate external applications with Finance and
    Operations so that you can import and export data by using data entities.

-   **Retail.** The following retail head-office capability will be included in
    Spring ’18 timeframe.

-   Product categories 

-   Channel categories and product attributes 

-   Attribute, attribute type, and attribute groups 

-   Trade agreements
