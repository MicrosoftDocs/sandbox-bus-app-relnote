#  Integration with Dynamics 365 for Talent (Public Preview)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and Operations customers can use Dynamics 365 for Talent to manage their
people. The integration provides the ability to integrate appropriate HR
information into Finance and Operations. It takes advantage of the data
management tools that are available in both Talent - Core HR and Finance and
Operations. It provides the ability to quickly front-load Talent - Core HR with
HCM data that currently resides in Finance and Operations. There will then be a
recurring integration flow from Talent to Finance and Operations.
