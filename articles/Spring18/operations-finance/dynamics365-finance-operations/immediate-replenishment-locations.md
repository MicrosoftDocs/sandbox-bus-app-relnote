#  Immediate replenishment of locations




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Immediate replenishment is used during wave execution if allocation fails for a
location directive line that has a replenishment template. Instead of having to
sum demand at the end of an allocation process and do replenishment based on the
total quantity, you can apply an immediate replenishment strategy.

When you use this strategy, the inventory can be replenished immediately after a
location directive line fails. Therefore, you can set up the replenishment so
that itâ€™s restricted by specific units and uses quantities that are set for
specific locations.
