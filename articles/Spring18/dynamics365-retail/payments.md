#  Payments




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Beginning with the Spring â€˜18 release, we have made investments to improve
tolerance when connecting to payment providers over unreliable networks. This
also includes a stateless payment stack to prevent payment failures from
crashing the POS app, and improved extensibility for payment scenarios at POS.
Issues with external components such as Hardware station, Payment connector, and
Payment device are better handled by POS, which reduces the likelihood of POS
app crashes due to payment failures. This functionality will be released
incrementally through application updates starting in Spring 2018.
