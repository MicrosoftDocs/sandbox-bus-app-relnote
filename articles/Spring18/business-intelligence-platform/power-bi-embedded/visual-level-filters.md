#  Visual level filters




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Additional APIs are available to support get, set, and remove filters on the
Visual level. This API complements the Filters API already available at the
report and page level, so now it supports all the UI experiences of the Filter
pane. For more information, see [Visual level
filters](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript/wiki/Filters).
