#  Metadata-driven responsive user experiences




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Model-driven apps are responsive across different form factors and devices,
allowing users to quickly continue their work while on the go.Â 

Responsive user experiences allow for:

-   A single layout for forms, dashboards, and lists that automatically reflows.

-   Navigation and grids that adapt to mobile devices to enable efficient touch
    interactions.

-   Visual controls that are optimized for touch and provide engaging user
    experiences. Examples include Slider, Arc, and Calendar controls.
