#  Service hardening




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

We have added service monitoring and alerting for core business processes, and
improved the form load performance of the most commonly used forms. We have also
improved the performance of business processes such as master planning and
warehouse wave processing, and added resiliency for account structure
activation.
