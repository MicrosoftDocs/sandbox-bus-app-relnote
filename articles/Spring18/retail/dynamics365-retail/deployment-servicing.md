#  Deployment and servicing




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Retail organizations, especially those with globally-distributed operations,
often find it challenging to pick a single maintenance window that is
simultaneously non-disruptive to their entire global operational footprint. With
near-zero downtime updates, most retail store operations can continue to work
even through maintenance windows. This allows organizations that prefer
low/no-footprint deployment to enjoy the same level of business continuity in
their stores, even with a cloud-only topology. Retailers also routinely
experience significant fluctuations in customer traffic based on seasonal
trends, flash sales, viral popularity, or weather events. Likewise, system load
during times of statement calculation and posting, or other batch processes, can
be disproportionately high. Resource governance between transactional and
back-office workloads ensures that long-running batch processes don't affect
transactional system performance, and that peak store traffic doesn't impede
back office operations.
