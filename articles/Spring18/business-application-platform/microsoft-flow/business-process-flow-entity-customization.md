#  Business process flow entity customization




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Because business processes flows are available as entities in the Common Data
Service for Apps, you can use advanced find results as well as views, charts,
and dashboards sourced from business process flow data for a given entity, such
as a lead or opportunity. Create custom business process flow grids, views,
charts, and dashboards that are similar to those created with any other entity.

Business process flows, such as Lead To Opportunity Sales Process, appear as a
customizable entity in Solution Explorer.

Several default views are available that you can view as a chart, such as the
Active Lead To Opportunity Sales Processes view.

Currently, you canâ€™t create custom forms for entities based on a business
process flow.
