#  Data sharing for customer and vendor tables




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

You can share the customer and vendor tables and many related tables across
multiple legal entities. Although data sharing was already available under
System Administration \> Setup \> Configure cross-company data sharing, tables
with the “Main” table group were not supported for cross-company data sharing.
The Spring '18 release enables data sharing for customers and vendors and for
related tables across a small number of legal entities. To enable this
functionality, contact your Solution Architect, who will verify that your
business requirements and data volumes will be acceptable for data sharing, and
then enable the sharing policies in your environment.
