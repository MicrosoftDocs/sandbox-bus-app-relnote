#  See details of a flow 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

When you run a flow that has been shared with you, you can see details of
exactly what that flow is going to do with your connections. Whenever you run a
flow, select **See details**, and you'll be presented with a list of every
action that flows uses (both name and description). Since the flow can use your
accounts or connections, you should only ever run a flow if you trust the owner
of the flow, and, are comfortable with them taking the actions listed
under **See details**.
