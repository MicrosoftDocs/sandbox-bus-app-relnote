#  Guided setup


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI Apps are available to users through
[AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/). A guided setup experience
helps users quickly install and set up the app. After users provide a few
details such as their DynamicsÂ 365 credentials, they are redirected to their
Power BI Service account where reports are readily available. Users receive a
notification after data is copied and their app is ready to use.
