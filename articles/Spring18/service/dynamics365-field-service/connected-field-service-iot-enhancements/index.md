#  Connected Field Service (IoT) enhancements




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Connected Field Service helps service organizations proactively detect,
troubleshoot, and resolve service issues so a technician is dispatched only when
necessary. Organizations can enable IoT alerts, device fault states, and
preventive maintenance notifications to let field service managers or
technicians know when to create a new case, create a work order, send commands
to control customer assets remotely, prepare parts needed for a repair, or take
other actions.
