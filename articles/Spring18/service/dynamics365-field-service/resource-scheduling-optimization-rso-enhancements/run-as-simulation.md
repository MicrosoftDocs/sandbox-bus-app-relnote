#  Run as a simulation 




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The admin can run a schedule on demand as a simulation, which results in
resource bookings that are simulations without affecting actual bookings. This
capability helps an administrator better understand the effects of adjusting
optimization scope, constraints, objectives, and other parameters, to determine
what optimization configuration best matches business goals and objectives.
