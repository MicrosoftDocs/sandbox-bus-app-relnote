#  Custom pricing dimensions for resource pricing




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

To maximize flexibility to meet different business requirements, the updated
Project Service solution supports discrete application of pricing dimension sets
to cost and bill rates. Dimension values can be set as the default and
propagated across the costing and pricing process from resource profiling to
time entry to project actuals. Customer-specific configuration and modification
or extension leverages standard DynamicsÂ 365 customizability infrastructure.
