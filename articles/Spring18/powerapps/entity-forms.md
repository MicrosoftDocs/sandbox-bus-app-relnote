#  Entity forms 




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Model-driven entity forms are a critical component in any Dynamics 365
application and are now available for standalone model‑driven apps built with
PowerApps.

Entity forms include the following features:

-   Multiple tabs. Craft purpose-built tabs for any entity.

-   Sub-grids. Show a list of related records from another entity.

-   Automatic responsive reflow. Forms adapt automatically to the type and size
    of device, and to various web browser resolutions.

-   Form-factor targeting. Choose custom controls that are shown only on mobile,
    for a purpose-built view.

-   Embedded business flow. Guide users through a specific set of steps.

-   Navigation. Add navigation links to other related entities.
