#  Add multiple records to array inputs




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

There are many actions in Flow that take an array as input. For example, the
**Send email** action has a list of attachments that can be included with the
email. Before, you could pass just one attachment, or you could generate a list
of attachments from the outputs of another action by using the **Select**
action. However, there was no easy way to just have *two* attachments.

So we're happy to announce that, for any action that takes a list as an input,
you can now add as many items inline as you want.

<!-- Picture 5 -->


*Array inputs*

To add a second (or third, fourth, and so on) attachment, just click the **Add
new item** button below the main fields for that attachment. Each time, you'll
get a new set of the fields for the new attachment (or any other record that
youâ€™re adding). To remove an item, select the ellipsis (...) menu next to the
first field in the record you want to delete.
