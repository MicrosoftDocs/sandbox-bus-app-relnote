#  Dynamics 365 for Talent – Attract




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Spring ‘18 releases expand recruiting management capabilities to include
support for career websites and for posting multiple jobs at the same time to
simplify the job posting process. We are continuing to build on our integration
with LinkedIn to include:



-   Apply with LinkedIn.

-   Post to LinkedIn.

-   Export candidates from Recruiter to Dynamics 365 for Talent.

The Spring '18 releases also add the ability to easily initiate candidate
assessments via Koru, a leading provider in this space. We are also releasing
Gauge, a companion application provided as part of Attract, that lets you easily
create candidate assessments and surveys.
