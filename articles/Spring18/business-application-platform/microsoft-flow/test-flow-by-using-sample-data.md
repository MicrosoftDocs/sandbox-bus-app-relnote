#  Test your flow by using sample data




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Test your flows after creating them to ensure that they work as you expect.

There are two ways to access the test flow:

-   Go to the flow details page, select the contextual menu (â€¦), and then select
    Test Flow.

\-or-

-   Select the Test button in the banner after saving your flow.

In the Test pane, there are three modes for testing your flow:

-   Let Flow trigger the test by using sample data.

-   Manually trigger the test yourself by doing the action that triggers the
    flow.

-   Use data from previous runs to perform the test.
