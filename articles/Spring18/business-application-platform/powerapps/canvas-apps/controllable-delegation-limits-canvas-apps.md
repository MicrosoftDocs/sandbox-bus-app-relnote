#  Controllable delegation limits for canvas apps




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can now control delegation limits for non-delegable data sources that have
up to a maximum of 2,000 records, allowing client-side operations to work on
larger datasets. By intentionally setting a low limit, you can also use this
capability to spot potential problems due to lack of delegation of operations.
