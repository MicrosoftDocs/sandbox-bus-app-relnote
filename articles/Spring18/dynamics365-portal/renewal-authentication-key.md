#  Renewal of authentication key




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

DynamicsÂ 365 Portal connects to an organization using an authentication key
linked to Azure Active Directory. The authentication key expires every two
years. The administrator receives notification on the key expiration date, and
can renew the authentication key. [For more information, go to Renew portal
authentication
key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/connect-with-dynamics#renew-portal-authentication-key).
