#  Keep the context when searching for availability and substituting a resource


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The solution supports keeping the context when a user moves an existing booking
to a different resource to make room for a new scheduling requirement. For
example, when a user searches for availability for a requirement, and the
resource for the requirement doesnâ€™t have the hours available, the user

may want to move an existing booking to another resource to make room for this
requirement. Plus, the user wants to make sure to move the existing booking to a
qualified resource with availability, without changing the booking time. Then,
when the user is done moving the existing booking, the user lands back in the
original Schedule Assistant context to continue working.
