#  Lead management




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Use landing pages to invite contacts to register with your organization and
generate leads based on those submissions. An automated, rule-based lead scoring
engine helps identify your hottest leads as they interact with your marketing
activities, and can automatically forward sales-ready leads to salespeople when
they reach a defined score threshold. Run lead-generation campaigns on LinkedIn
and import those leads directly into Dynamics 365 for follow-up, nurturing, and
eventual qualification.

Dynamics 365 business apps share the same platform, making it possible to share
data and collaborate with sales, marketing, customer service, and other business
groups.
