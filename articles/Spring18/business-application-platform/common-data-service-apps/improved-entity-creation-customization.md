#  Improved entity creation and customization 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Creating and customizing Common Data Service for Apps entities from
PowerApps.com is improved in the following ways:

-   **Improved entity experience.** The experience for viewing, editing, and
    creating entities has been redesigned to take advantage of the latest Common
    Data Service for Apps features and the latest experience standards.

-   **See only what you need.** Entity lists are now filtered to recommended
    views to make it easier to find what you need. Change the filter to “all” to
    see system entities and other less commonly used items. When creating
    entities and adding fields, you can focus on the most important decisions
    in-line, and then expand to more advanced options when needed.

-   **Simplified in-line experiences.** Improve productivity when customizing
    entities by creating option sets directly in-line when adding fields to your
    entities. There’s no need to switch contexts.
